Or perhaps you’d rather experience the holidays “under the sea.” Either way, this Italian restaurant in Southington, Connecticut, is the place to go.\n\nCava Restaurant has turned its dining rooms into a winter wonderland with decorations inspired by scenes from “Harry Potter,” “The Phantom of the Opera,” “The Little Mermaid” and “Frozen.”\n\nAccording to manager Tony Papahristou, there are more than 20,000 ornaments and 100,000 lights throughout the restaurant. “People are blown away from the moment they walk in the door,” he told TODAY Home. And it’s easy to understand why once you see inside.\n\nThis is the 10th anniversary of the restaurant decorating for the holidays and each year, they give every room a different theme. Past themes have included “The Great Gatsby,” “Cinderella” and “Beauty and the Beast.”\n\nPapahristou said they usually spend around $20,000 on new decorations each year, incorporating the old with the new. This year, there’s around $100,000 worth of decorations in the building.\n\nIn the “Harry Potter” room, diners will find an homage to the Gryffindor House. The room features floating candles, hung with magician string. Illuminated presents and upside-down trees hang from the ceiling, making it feel as if someone has cast a spell on the objects (Harry? Is that you?). The ornaments are in Gryffindor’s colors of gold and red.\n\nCandles \"float\" in the air in the \"Harry Potter\" room.Cava Restaurant\n\nA custom-made replica of the infamous chandelier in “The Phantom of the Opera” hangs in the next room, which is decorated as a nod to the famous Broadway play. Papahristou said the decor includes commissioned artwork and some more subtle touches from the show.\n\nHopefully the chandelier won't come crashing down like it does in \"The Phantom of the Opera.\"Cava Restaurant\n\nYou can also dine in Ursula’s lair from “The Little Mermaid.” The room’s color scheme is purple and black and features giant ornate tentacles suspended from the ceiling and walls. Clear ball ornaments that resemble bubbles hang from above, giving off the effect that you’re under water.\n\nYou'll feel like you're dining under the sea in Ursula's lair!Cava Restaurant\n\nAnd the “Frozen” room is surrounded by hundreds of glistening icicles. If it’s too cold, you can warm up with a cup of the restaurant’s specialty hot cocoa at the bar.\n\nHoliday stress? Let it go in the \"Frozen\" room.Cava Restaurant\n\nWhat’s even more special about these decorations is that they were all put up by the staff of the restaurant. It took five weeks to complete the massive project.\n\nRecommended\nSHOP - ON THE SHOW\nShop TODAY Trend Report: August picks from brands like Clinique, Coach and more\nSHOP - ON THE SHOW\nThese practical finds will make any routine easier, starting at $10\n\nPapahristou said people have been coming from different surrounding states just to see it.

Just as soon as the kids are out of school and you can plan all sorts of adventures, it seems as though you’re getting ready for them to head back to school. If you’re like me, you find yourself wondering “Why does summer have to end?” Well, let’s have a few more fun adventures before the busy school year starts, okay? Here are some summer vacation ideas to take around the U.S. These are great for last-minute getaways for a few days of rest, relaxation, fun, and summer memories with the fam.\n\nBeach Vacations\n\nI am a beach girl through and through. I grew up in the Ocean State (Rhode Island), and I escape the summer desert heat of where I now live in Arizona by spending it mostly in the Bay State (Massachusetts). While I always recommend the beaches of Cape Cod to anyone who will listen, here are some other wonderful beach vacation destinations for a quick getaway in the U.S.:\n\n1. Gulf Shores, Alabama\nGulf Shores, AL, USA\nJim McKinley/Moment via Getty Images\nNeed an escape from the Southern heat and humidity this summer? A trip to the beach city Gulf Shores along the Gulf Coast is just what you need! With a gorgeous stretch of white sand and the temperate turquoise waters of the Gulf, it's like having a tropical vacay without leaving the country. Set up your beach blanket and umbrella, and make sure you bring the beach toys for the kids. A day at the beach in Gulf Shores, Alabama is a day well spent.\n\nOnce you're done with the beach, head into the town of Gulf Shores where you'll find shops, restaurants, the Alabama Gulf Coast Zoo, a family entertainment center, and more. You can also take a scenic or dolphin-watching cruise if you'd like as well! If you need a place to stay while visiting Gulf Shores, check out the Best Western On The Beach.\n2. Kennebunkport, Maine\nKennebunkport, ME 04046, USA\nmike innella/iStock / Getty Images Plus via Getty Images\nIf you ever ask Mainers what is the friendliest town in the state, you’ll most likely be told Kennebunkport. This picturesque coastal town is quintessential New England in every way. The town has three official beaches — Gooch's Beach, Middle Beach, and Mother's Beach. However, if you’re worried about swim safety, only Gooch’s and Mother’s Beaches have lifeguards from mid-June through early September. If you’re taking a Maine beach vacation with kids, I would opt for swimming at one of those two beaches.\n\nNow, the beach isn’t the only thing that Kennebunkport has to offer. Head downtown and you’ll find a vibrant atmosphere as well as shops, restaurants, and galleries. Not to mention, the town is absolutely charming! Speaking of charming, for accommodations, you may want to consider a vacation rental like the stylish and luxurious 3-bedroom, 2-bath Captain's Manor. Best of all, it’s located close to all that Kennebunkport has to offer.\nAdvertisement\n3. Florence, Oregon\nFlorence, OR 97439, USA\nJohn C Magee/Moment via Getty Images\nI love small beach towns. In fact, I spend my summers in a small beach community every summer. If this is the type of beachy getaway you’re looking for, the town of Florence on the Central Oregon coast is the place for you. It’s quiet and peaceful and oh-so-pretty! Florence is situated at the mouth of the Siuslaw River where you’ll find the town’s most notable landmark, the Historic Siuslaw River Bridge. (And if you’re wondering, yes, the bridge is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.)\n\nIf you want to hang out on a gorgeous stretch of sand for the day and even fly kites, Heceta Beach is where you should go. For those who want more of an adventure, head to Jessie M. Honeyman State Park where you can go sandboarding and even take a dune buggy tour. This coastal beach park also has camping and yurts. However, if you prefer less rustic accommodations, consider staying at a place like the Ocean Breeze Motel in Florence.\nAdvertisement\n4. Wrightsville Beach, North Carolina\nWrightsville Beach, NC, USA\nSean Pavone/iStock / Getty Images Plus via Getty Images\nOh, how I love Wrightsville Beach! When I was working on a show in Wilmington, I would come to this barrier island as often as possible to relax, and taking a walk along the sand was so therapeutic to me. While here, I would often meet coworkers for a bite at Tower 7 Baja Mexican Grill which has the best fish tacos around! Those were the days…\n\nWrightsville Beach is beautiful, it’s relaxing, and it’s a lot of fun for adults and children alike. There are plenty of eateries in town as well as cute souvenir shops. However, it’s a quick drive to Wilmington if you want to explore the coastal city and all it has to offer as well.\n\nIf you plan on taking a quick getaway to Wrightsville this summer, book a stay at the Blockade Runner Beach Resort with ocean views, an on-site restaurant, and an indoor pool.\n5. Laguna Beach, California\nLaguna Beach, CA, USA\nLuciano Lejtman/Moment via Getty Images\nLaguna Beach is a stunning destination for a Southern California getaway any time of the year. However, it’s such a lively place to spend time in the summer. The weather is warm, the sun is shining, and being here will make you fall in love with SoCal if you’re not already. In a 7-mile stretch of coastline, Laguna has nine coves and 30 beaches, so you certainly have your pick of where to spend your days lazing under the sun. Kids will love building sand castles and exploring tide pools, and parents will love all there is to do in town. There’s so much that the family will love doing together like, perhaps, a snorkeling tour, trolley rides through town, whale watching, picnics at Treasure Island Park, and so much more. This is such an amazing beach town for a family getaway, even one that’s last minute.\n\nIf you need a place to stay, take a look at this Villa just a few blocks from Main Beach and book your stay on Airbnb.\nBig City Escapes\n\nAs much as I love the beach, I also love cities. There’s always so much to see, do, and experience. Between the culture and the history, the people and the restaurants, it’s certainly exciting to explore some of the country’s biggest cities on a summer vacay.\n\n6. Seattle, Washington\nSeattle, WA, USA\nStuart Westmorland/Corbis Documentary via Getty Images\nA city like Seattle has so much to offer for a family getaway. To start, there are iconic sites like Pike’s Place Market and the Space Needle, which are must-visit attractions, especially if you’re visiting Seattle for the first time. There’s also an abundance of museums like The Museum of Flight and the Museum of Pop Culture. If you prefer to visit nature spots in and around the city, I’d say head to Kerry Park where you can have a lovely picnic, take a stroll through the Washington Park Arboretum, and, of course, visit the zoo. There are so many wonderful places to visit around town. But if you want to get out on the water, get tickets for a whale watch which will fill you and the kids with awe and wonder.\n\nFor accommodations, take a look at some of the best places to stay in Seattle.\nRelated Stories\nHere Are 10 Incredible U.S. Spots Where You Can Still Find Snow In Summer\n12 Unique Places To Cool Off During The Dog Days Of Summer Across The U.S.\nMarvel At The Cosmos At These Stunning Stargazing & Dark Sky Destinations In The U.S.\n7. Boston, Massachusetts\nBoston, MA, USA\nDenisTangneyJr/iStock / Getty Images Plus via Getty Images\nAs a native New Englander, I have spent a lot of time in Boston throughout my life. Now that I have kids, I am always excited to show them the city when we come to town to visit family. There’s no other city quite like Boston! Not only is it picturesque but there are so many places that are perfect for kids. You can take them on a history tour along the Freedom Trail then grab a bite to eat at Quincy Market or Faneuil Hall. Go to the North End to get a treat at Mike’s Pastry. Then there’s the New England Aquarium that my kids absolutely love, especially the touch tank. The Boston Science Museum never disappoints and you can also get another history lesson at the Boston Tea Party Ships & Museum. And don’t forget to take the kids for a Swan Boat ride at the Public Garden and take in a baseball game at Fenway. I could go on and on about all there is to do in Boston!\n\nIf you need a place to stay in the city, I suggest making a reservation at the Boston Marriott Long Wharf that's close to many of the city's attractions.\n8. Branson, Missouri\nBranson, MO 65616, USA\nUndefined/Moment via Getty Images\nIf you’re looking for an incredibly fun Midwest tourist destination for a family getaway this summer, there’s perhaps no better place than Branson, Missouri. With so many attractions along 76 Country Boulevard alone, you’ll have no problem finding things to do that the whole family can enjoy. Among the notable attractions in town are the World’s Largest Toy Museum, the Hollywood Wax Museum, the Silver Dollar City theme park, and the Shepherd of the Hills Adventure Park. As if that wasn’t enough, you can take a riverboat cruise aboard the Showboat Branson Belle, take in a show and have dinner at Dolly Parton’s Stampede, and learn about marine life at the Aquarium at the Boardwalk. While the city of Branson isn’t as big as others on this list, it’s no less packed with things to do! In fact, you may find yourself a bit overwhelmed by everything there is to do here, so make sure you check out our Weekend Getaway Guide to Branson to help plan your vacation.\nAdvertisement\n9. Santa Fe, New Mexico\nSanta Fe, NM, USA\nSean Pavone/iStock / Getty Images Plus via Getty Images\nThe heat in the Southwest can really get hot so it’s always best to head to higher elevations during the summer months. One city that sits at a higher elevation is Santa Fe. And did you know that Santa Fe is the highest state capital in the U.S. at nearly 7,200 feet? It’s true! So, I think taking a summer vacation here is a great idea, especially since temperatures average in the low-to-mid 80s.\n\nWhen visiting Santa Fe, you must check out the Santa Fe Opera which performs outdoor concerts during the summer months. There are also plenty of hiking trails around town if you want to spend time out in nature. Kids will also love Meow Wolf, an immersive and interactive art attraction with 70 rooms…it’s unlike anything you’ve experienced before!\n\nIf you plan on taking your family on a last-minute summer getaway to Santa Fe, check out the Hilton Santa Fe Historic Plaza and book your stay on Hotels.com.\nNature Getaways\n\nFor a more relaxing vacation idea, head out into nature. With hiking and camping options and, perhaps, the opportunity to go boating or fishing, the following spots should absolutely go on your summer bucket list!\n\n10. State Parks in Oglesby, Illinois\nOglesby, IL 61348, USA\nJoe Hendrickson/iStock / Getty Images Plus via Getty Images\nHome to two incredible state parks, the town of Oglesby, Illinois is perfect for a multi-day nature escape. Within the town, you'll find Starved Rock State Park as well as Matthiessen State Park.\n\nLet’s start with Starved Rock State Park. Throughout this 2,630-acre park, you’ll be able to hike over 13 miles of trails and explore 18 sandstone canyons, some of which have waterfalls. You can also spend time out on the Illinois River while you’re here and enjoy activities such as fishing and boating. While Starved Rock is arguably one of the most beautiful places in the state, Matthiessen State Park may be a close second.\n\nJust 3 miles away from Starved Rock State Park is the 1,938-acre Matthiessen State Park. Here you will find a series of canyons, rock formations, waterfalls, prairies, and 5 miles of trails. It’s less crowded than Starved Rock if you’re seeking a more peaceful nature escape.\n11. Adirondack Mountains of New York\nAdirondack Mountains, Adirondack Mountains\nlightphoto/iStock / Getty Images Plus via Getty Images\nThe Adirondack Mountains of New York span an epic 6 million acres and are home to 3,000 lakes, over 100 towns and villages, fields, forests, rivers, streams, and countless ways to enjoy nature here. Over 2,000 miles of hiking trails make it easy to explore the Adirondacks and, of course, boating, fishing, swimming, and paddling are some of the best activities to enjoy during the summer months. A vacation in the Adirondack Mountains is certainly memorable for kids and adults alike.\n\nOf course, choosing a town for your Adirondack vacation may be a little overwhelming given the sheer size of the mountain range but we have narrowed it down to some of the best and most charming towns in the Adirondacks that you’ll have to check out.\n12. Lake Tahoe, California & Nevada\nLake Tahoe, United States\nMariuszBlach/ iStock / Getty Images Plus via Getty Images\nLake Tahoe has to be one of the most popular spots for a lake vacation in the country. And there are plenty of reasons why. This stunning lake in the Sierra Nevada Mountains is 22 miles long and 17 miles wide, has 72 miles of shoreline, and straddles the border between California and Nevada. With its pristine blue waters, Lake Tahoe is picture-perfect making it so tempting to vacation here. Whether you want to go for a swim or a paddle, lay on a beach, or go for a hike, Tahoe is one of the best places in the country to immerse yourself in nature.\n\nIf you want to take a summer lake vacation at Tahoe, here are a couple of accommodation options:\n1. On the California side of Lake Tahoe, check out the 3-bedroom, 2.5-bath Tahoe Vista Cabin located just a couple minutes from the beach.\n2. On the Nevada side of Lake Tahoe, take a look at the Tahoe Oasis, a luxurious 1-bedroom, 2-bath lakeside home complete with a private dock and beach.\n\nSo, there you have it — a few summer vacation ideas for you to consider for a getaway before the summer ends and the kids have to go back to school.

We create customized holiday and landscape lighting displays from residential clients to large-scale commercial properties. We love lighting homes and spreading holiday cheer throughout the neighborhood. But we also find so much joy in creating displays in commercial spaces such as malls, office complexes, and city centers.\n\nOur company is matchless in its professionalism and creativity, with a quality you can trust. We are committed to the details and getting every job done right the first time. We are relentless about creating displays that produce jaw-dropping reactions.

If you’d like to share your own experience with us, please email us at info@britenites.com\n\n“Thank you Brite Nites for your beautiful tree light displays for the second year in row! I look forward to seeing you all each year. It is such a joy to do business with such a professional company that is always on time, fast, efficient and cleans up after themselves.  You go above and beyond the call of duty and for that I am grateful.  This is a business relationship that will last a lifetime!”\nRoxanne R.\n\t\n“I cannot speak highly enough of Dean Lyons and his Brite Nite crews. Whatever the request, Dean and his folks have come through and at a level that consistently surpassed my super high expectations. I’ve yet to be able to come up with a project that Dean and his folks couldn’t handle and turn out right. The compliments and accolades for Dean’s lighting work at my home keep on coming all year long—even after the lights are down—and have helped establish a tradition of lighting that my family, my neighbors, my guests and even strangers driving by my home have come to enjoy, season after season, year after year.”\nNemeroff Family\n\n\n\n“Brite Nites’ lighting design illuminated our landscaping in a way that brought it to life…we strongly recommend Brite Nites.”\n\nDean England\nPresident – C.R. England\n\t\n“Their service & attention to detail, simply perfection”\nKen Keller\n\n\n“Kudos to Bill White for the magnificent Christmas display at the Farm on State road 224. It is brought to us by Brite Nites. They do a marvelous job of decorating those trees, and many other trees in our area. the colors are just fabulous, and add such a wonderful spirit to the holiday season. Visitors to Park City should be very impressed!”\nKaren Tafuri\n\t\n“Me, myself, and all of my businesses love Brite Nites! They do all of our lights on every one of my restaurants. Definitely recommend.”\nBill White\nPresident of Bill White Enterprises\n\n\n“Dean Lyons and his team are dedicated and professional, they work carefully with you, and together you decide on the best approach for your Holiday lighting needs. The residents of SunCrest have commented yearly about how beautiful our grounds look and how festive it makes the holiday season.”\nTracy Kelly\nAdministrative Coordinator – SunCrest HOA\n\t\n“Brite Nites has been my go-to company for lighting and decor for over 12 years. In all that time I have always been completely satisfied. They do an excellent job, very dependable, and offer the most competitive prices. Brite Nites is a company that has always created exactly what we have requested in the time we have needed it.” \nHeather Nash\nMarketing Director – Outlets at Traverse Mountain\n\n\n“Brite Nite’s customer service is the best. They were very attentive to my concerns and most importantly answered my questions honestly and directly. I think the most impressive thing about this company is they say what they will do and then they DO what they said they would do. I would recommend Brite Nites to anyone without hesitation!”\nBrian Stauffer\n\t\n“Brite Nites’ lights are amazing! We had ours installed just before Christmas and they have been on every night since. Installers were professional, friendly and got the lights up really fast! They also did a super job cleaning up and were careful of our house and flowerbeds during install. We love the patterns and color combinations…Thanks for a great product — lots of compliments from our neighbors!”\nLaurie Sweetland\n\n\n\n“Emma was great! She came to our house and gave us options for our Christmas lighting needs. We used this company in 2020 and had no problems. Then decided to go with Laguna Lighting local company in 2021 who put up lights but never had time to take lights down. What a disaster that was! I had to pay extra to have another company take down. So this year we are back with Brite Nites as I can trust they will do all that’s contracted of them. Cost is a bit higher but definitely can count on them for excellent service!”\n\nJane Reindle\nSouthern California – Google Review\n\t\n\n“I have been a returning client with Brite Nites for many years now. And I can’t tell you how much I recommend this lighting company. From the design/install/takedown the process is so smooth. The designers are always so friendly/knowledgeable and have the best input. I have have had different companies in years past but Brite Nites by FAR exceeds my expectations.”\n\nShirin Nikan\nBay Area – Google Review\nWe appreciate all of the testimonials!

LED emits a pure light not necessarily colored by the painted glass or a plastic globe. With the power off, most LEDs are clear. Turn the power on, and the pure color is easily seen.\n\n• Lower Energy Requirements\n\nOn average, LEDs use up to 90% less electricity, reducing your electric bill considerably. Our lighting designers consider power and energy when designing your Christmas light installation.\n\n• Comfortably Cool Bulbs\n\nIncandescent bulbs burn hot. You know from bitter experience if you’ve ever touched one while it was lit! But thanks to their superior energy efficiency, LED bulbs generate very little heat. No need to worry about children or pets being burned by scorching hot bulbs.\n\n• Bulbs That Last, and Last, and Last\n\nYou can expect  25,000 to 75,000 hours of service from an LED bulb. Brite Nites provides only the highest quality, energy-efficient lighting materials and products.\n\n\t\t\nAre you ready for Christmas?

Friendly, knowledgeable people from the sales department through delivery/installation are my main reason for this review.Amy, my sales person, was most helpful while I decided on the final options for my new shed.l especially enjoyed watching Tyler move the shed to the back of my yard using the equipment remote control.The shed is well built and looks great, so thanks and appreciation go out to the build team.Thank you Kloter Farms.\nMartin Duda\n17 days ago\nExcellent experience; Jordan, John, and Tyler were a great team to deal with. HIGHLY recommend Kloter farms for any of your shred projects\nSusan Driscoll\n19 days ago\nI ordered a greenhouse which has been a dream of mine. The workmanship is amazing with a 10 year warranty. The guys that delivered it were so nice. I was worried about them coming down our deadend road and being able to maneuver it down into yard but they handled it like pros and got it installed in no time. They checked all the windows and gave me great tips. Couldn't be happier with the entire experience.\nEvan Hahn\n25 days ago\nMy wife and I purchased a 12' x 16' shed in June and just had it installed. We can't say enough how impressed we were with the quality of the shed (all plywood, not beaver board), and with the professionalism/quality of the guys who prepared the base and delivered the shed. These guys REALLY know what they're doing. WELL DONE everyone.\nJason Marineau\na month ago\nWe have been customers of Kloter Farms for a number of years now having purchased our bedroom and living room furniture from them. Quality is the standard here. I finally had saved for the shed I wanted for years and it was no different in this purchase too. From the sales process to the site prep and then delivery it was professional and seamless. I've had the shed a couple months now and I couldn't be happier! The outdoor equipment is happy too😀\nMerri Scarbrough\na month ago\nKloter Farms is fantastic! From the start of our journey of purchasing a shed to the actual delivery - which was very challenging to put the shed in the tight area it had to go - amazing journey! I would definitely recommend them on all their options, pricing and quality. THANK YOU!\nLena Garcia\na month ago\nWe ordered one shed from Kloter and had such a fantastic experience we ordered a second! Happy to recommend this family owned business.\nMark Wilson\na month ago\nWorking with Kloter Farms is without a doubt one of the best experiences in retail. Their willingness to find the right shed at the right price was most noteworthy. Everything from the purchase, site prep, and delivery was professional and well communicated. Steve went above and beyond with the site prep and I learned that \"level\" and \"flat\" are not the same thing. Delivery was a site to behold - Dan got the shed on the pad within an 1/8 inch of dead center and was willing to spend as much time getting it right as needed. I cannot say enough about this company and the experience!\nHugh Anderson\na month ago\nWe had a great experience with Kloter Farms. Great quality and selection, comfortable low stress shopping with no pressure, and on time delivery. We highly recommend Kloter Farms and will be back.\nBarbara Frassinelli\na month ago\nsorry this comes so late but no less meaningful the young Ulitsch who delivered our shed on June 6 did such an excellent job so quickly and expertly that I cannot say enough good things about him.I believe his name was Ryan ,forgive my memory.Our adult children were here and marveled at his ability also.Thank you for sending him to deliver this lovely shed.\nWilliam Rivera\n2 months ago\nWhat a wonderful company! We purchased a shed from Kloter Farms and could not be more pleased with the service and quality of the product. Our salesperson, Kim M, was an absolute delight to work with. She took videos and pictures of the shed we were interested in and shared a ton of info which gave us the comfort to buy it without going to the showroom. Moreover, the delivery team (Dillon and Ron) were equally amazing. Very nice guys and extremely skilled. I was impressed how they were able to get the shed to the exact spot I needed within a tight space.What’s next? Maybe a kitchen!Highly recommend Kloter Farms!\nJoseph Bush\n2 months ago\nTook a leap after doing a bunch of internet research and bought a shed sight unseen. Very happy with the process and support. Delivery and install team was very professional and timely. Build quality seems great. Now time to finish the man cave vision!\nBeverly Olson\n2 months ago\nKloter Farms has always been a great place to shop. The staff is always courteous and helpful. Had a shed delivered on Tuesday and all went very well. The young man, Tyler, that delivered was a very nice man and did a great job. Kloter Farms always has very good quality merchandise.\nJudy Weinstein\n2 months ago\nWe went to Kloter Farms for the first time, intending to buy just an outdoor shed. Not only did we do that, but we loved the furniture store and ended up with a character walnut table, four upholstered chairs, and a stunning hutch! Their showroom contained a huge variety of styles and materials, and we were thrilled to be able to design our own contemporary pieces with the help of wonderful Noah Welti. We definitely recommend Kloter Farms for its quality, value and customer service.\ntodd nilsson\n2 months ago\nI could not be happier from sale to delivery top shelf company. Thank you for making my day! Todd\nMichael Jalbert\n2 months ago\nIts like that old Rolling Rock Beer slogan, \"Same as it always was\". We purchased our first Kloter Farms shed twenty two years for our home in CT. It was one of the more memorable and pleasurable home improvement projects we have experienced. The Kloter Farms staff was professional/courteous and accommodating. The shed was of great quality, workmanship, and competitively priced. We recently purchased our second Kloter Farms shed for our retirement home in RI. From the selection and sale process with Amy to the delivery and installation process with Christian it was the same as it always was. We look forward to our next project with Kloter Farms - our garage and workshop.\nmichael pittaro\n2 months ago\nCustomer service excellent. Professional staff and delivery people.

We were able to review the stock on line and call and place an order with the store. Delivery was free and the driver did a fine job positioning the 8 x 12 shed. We are extremely happy with the quality of the building.\nlisa casolo\n3 months ago\nBrett & Dan were awesome the whole Kloter Farm team has been excellent. We purchased our shed about five years ago. Recently a large tree fell nearly slicing the shed in half. Left for work this morning- when I returned they had repaired it and it looked like new. I highly recommend them and will be back for another shed soon!\nGary Bohara\n3 months ago\nChristian and Bill were excellent, they did a great job figuring out how to get the shed on my pad.Can’t say enough about the two of them, also Kloter Farms is excellent to work with.Thank you for the great service\nD K\n3 months ago\nGreat company to work with! From the ordering personal to the installers. Very professional and friendly. They knocked it out of the park on this build! Thank you!🙏🏻\nPenny Lebel\n3 months ago\nThis is our second out building from Kloter. This one is my “cottage “. With Nicks help, I was able to get everything that I envisioned. From the size of the building to the amount of windows that I wanted and the doors I wanted as well. The site preparation was meticulously accomplished by their contractor. On delivery day I was in awe when I saw the truck coming down my street. It’s beautiful, I am so happy. The delivery people are professionals, they placed it perfectly on the pad. I can’t say enough wonderful things about Kloter Farms. Except thank you for your exceptional customer service and quality of your product.\nDan Griffin\n4 months ago\nCalled kloters because I needed my Kloter sheds moved to my new residence as we had moved.They came out and scoped it out as it was a tight fit to remove the sheds .I have to say I was very impressed with those trailers and their ability to minipulate them to get the job done. It was a task but they handled it with ease.Professional,courteous, very knowledgeable service .\nHarold Kershaw\n4 months ago\nWe just completed a most enjoyable buying experience with Kloter Farms with the purchase of a 10x16 shed. Sales personnel, Richard, was most informative and patient in assisting us. Steve and Chris from S&D construction installed the blue stone pad with exceptional skill and results. Today, Chris from Kloter Farms, in spite of an early spring wintry mix, arrived in Springfield from Ellington to skillfully maneuver the shed placement within limited confines. A great team effort from start to finish, and well worth the purchase and then some. Thank you Kloter Farms.\nMichelle Vacca\n4 months ago\nThis is my 8th purchase from Kloter if you want the best furniture these folks is where you need to go! I have a shed,bedframe,tv bookcase, 2 smith brothers leather furniture chairs, and a beautiful bookcase. The quality never disapoints me. Love Kloter Farms thank you\nJerry Vernazza\n5 months ago\nThis is now my 2nd structure purchased form Kloter Farms. I could not be happier with the entire transaction! From sales to delivery EVERYONE involved are true professionals! If you're in the market for an outdoor structure...Look no further. They are TOP SHELF!!Jerry / Stamford\nKatie Fisher Team\n10 months ago\nWe purchased 2 custom sheds. I can't say enough about the care and service we received from our first visits with Kim.

We are very happy and plan on recommending Kim and Kloter Farms to all are friends.\nBill Henson\n10 months ago\nIncredible experience. Everyone we met was so nice.

We love our Kloter shed/garage and when it came time to sell our home, we wanted to take it with us! They were all amazing! Paul @ the office was super helpful and responsive and let me tell you about the drivers. This was not an easy shed to get to on a hill half in the woods - I was 5 min late getting there and they already had it done! The delivery/drop off was a breeeze too! I can't recommend them enough! Friendly, reliable, responsive and skilled!\nroy cargile\n11 months ago\nIt was a long process only because we didn't know what we wanted...spoke with many places, did research went to Home Shows...finally went to Kloter Farms and pulled the trigger. We couldn't be happier with our choice. I can't recommend Klotter enough, Kim our Saleswoman to Dan who delivered it...top notch service.

Dan fit a 10ft wide shed in a 10 ft 2 inch space\nJoanne Nesbitt\n11 months ago\nKloter Farms is beautiful inside and out! Our sales rep was Paul who we dealt with and couldn't ask for a nicer person. Several calls and emails and always 100% customer service. From the day of purchase to removal of old shed and prep for new shed was outstanding. The delivery of the new shed was amazing. Everything was done perfectly and no issues at all. Nicest group of people from start to finish. 100% satisfied and would always go back again. We are pleased with our new shed and just can't say enough.......perfection!\nJohn Sheehy\na year ago\nOne of the best purchase experiences I’ve ever had. From the moment I contacted Kloter Farm about an in stock shed they had until the truck pulled away after delivering it, everything was 10 STARS. Kim in Sales was excellent in every aspect, sending pictures, payment options, site preparation and delivery notifications. Tyler, the delivery genius was a master at his craft, maneuvering the truck and trailer into my back yard to perfectly place the shed. I got the impression he could have done it in his sleep. The shed is beautiful and constructed extremely well. I certainly made the right choice and I would recommend Kloter Farms to anyone who asks.\nLynn Clark\na year ago\nThis is the second time we have gone to Kloter for a structure on our property.The first was a large shed and that experience was very gratifying and we love our little barn. It's too beautiful to be called a shed. This time we went for a two car garage and the experience was amazing. First, Jason Kloter came to our home with a truckful of samples, pictures, ideas, etc. and sat with us for two hours helping us design the garage. It is now up and looks fabulous. The team that built the foundation and redesigned the driveway as well as the team that assembled the garage were excellent. We cannot thank you all enough.\nVincent Vassallo\na year ago\nWent to Kloter Farms for a replacement shed. The whole company is top notch. Great salesperson, Kim. The site work man was great and did good work. She'd looks great, had a bubble in one of the siding pieces when shed arrived on Tuesday, contacted the company and siding was replaced Thursday the same week. Great customer service all around. Thanks for making our shed buying experience seamless. Vin and Kelly Vasssllo\nJanice Favreau\na year ago\nWe have been customers of Kloter Farms since the purchase of our home 8 years ago, and are extremely pleased with the quality of the product and the service received.

We run a small dog rescue; Little Rhody Rescue and Quarantine Inc in Glocester RI.First, the team was professional, courteous and my finished product was EXACTLY what I ordered and wanted. The price was reasonable - especially for the quality that I received!We received a beautiful grant from the singer Miranda Lambert's Mutt Nation Foundation. We cleared trees, prepped for the bug day ! Delivery was flawless and SO fast!....Then the pandemic hit. Our 'office' allowed us to hold adoption events even when all of the stores were closed to adoption events.This beautiful 'Shed' has become a lifeline and helped us to save 1,200 dogs' and cats' lives- all because it enabled us to continue our work!!!Thanks I can recommend no one more!\nMichael Magner\na year ago\nMy shed was delivered yesterday and I can't tell you how happy I am with it! It has solved all of my outdoor storage needs and then some, and it is beautiful! A special shout-out to Tyler the delivery guy. I was thoroughly amazed at his expertise in getting into my difficult driveway (even the garbage man won't come down it) and the way he handled that trailer all by himself and landed the shed exactly where I wanted it. It's 10 X 20\" so no easy task. I highly recommend these guys! Thanks again Tyler!\nJohn Briare\na year ago\nAbsolutely Amazing Company and Staff. Bought a 12x14 Cape Shed. I was at the tail end of a major patio renovation and decided to demolish a mouse infested shed that I have had for 30 years. Problem was... I needed the shed delivered within 2 weeks before area would become non-accessible. I first went to a shed dealer down the road... was told it would be 8-12 weeks... nothing they could do. Thinking I was going to be building the new shed myself... I tried Kloter Farms. I told them my dilemma and they said no problem... they could get it done within 2 weeks. Walked the yard... found a beautiful shed... signed the paperwork and literally got a call within 36 hours and shed was delivered to my house within 72 hours of first stepping foot in their showroom. They bailed me out big time. As far as price... I understand building a shed would save money... but with screws running $40 for 5 lbs, and lumber prices insane... It cost me about $1500 over cost of materials, not including tax, to simply buy the shed from Kloter. I will never build my own shed again. Great Quality... ask for Joe Schneider (Sales Rep I dealt with)\nAshor Yousif\na year ago\nWe bought a shed last year from Kolter Farms. We love it. We had to call for a minor issue covered under the warranty. The repair was perfectly completed in a very timely manner. The service tech was very professional. IIhighly recommend\nRay Hoyt\na year ago\nFrom start to finish, the entire experience with Kloter Farms was excellent. We purchased an elite cape building and a large storage shed.

It's 10 X 20\" so no easy task. I highly recommend these guys! Thanks again Tyler!\nJohn Briare\na year ago\nAbsolutely Amazing Company and Staff. Bought a 12x14 Cape Shed. I was at the tail end of a major patio renovation and decided to demolish a mouse infested shed that I have had for 30 years. Problem was... I needed the shed delivered within 2 weeks before area would become non-accessible. I first went to a shed dealer down the road... was told it would be 8-12 weeks... nothing they could do. Thinking I was going to be building the new shed myself... I tried Kloter Farms. I told them my dilemma and they said no problem... they could get it done within 2 weeks. Walked the yard... found a beautiful shed... signed the paperwork and literally got a call within 36 hours and shed was delivered to my house within 72 hours of first stepping foot in their showroom. They bailed me out big time. As far as price... I understand building a shed would save money... but with screws running $40 for 5 lbs, and lumber prices insane... It cost me about $1500 over cost of materials, not including tax, to simply buy the shed from Kloter. I will never build my own shed again. Great Quality... ask for Joe Schneider (Sales Rep I dealt with)\nAshor Yousif\na year ago\nWe bought a shed last year from Kolter Farms. We love it. We had to call for a minor issue covered under the warranty. The repair was perfectly completed in a very timely manner. The service tech was very professional.

It has been a great project all starting with Kloter Farms quality products and service. THANK YOU ! Come out and have a pint!\n\nCustom Pool Houses & Prefab Sheds\n\nLooking to add the perfect finishing touch to your pool area? A custom pool house, pool shed, gazebo, or pergola is an excellent option. Not only do these outdoor structures look great, but they can serve a variety of purposes, too, from storing pool floats to offering much-needed shade on hot days.\n\nNo matter what kind of pool house you have in mind, Kloter Farms is here to help you make it a reality.\n\nThe Many Benefits of Pool Houses\n\nPools are popular with homeowners for many reasons. From relaxing at home to entertaining friends and family, they have the potential to enrich and enhance our lives in many ways. The only thing better than having a pool? Having one with a pool house!\n\nThese structures offer incredible functionality when incorporated into your property design. The most obvious reason for having a pool house is storage. Whether you’re looking for a place to keep patio furniture, seasonal items, pool gear and supplies, or anything else, a pool house can help you keep your outdoor area neat, organized, and looking its best. Of course, there’s also the fact that a clutter-free environment is essential to true relaxation.\n\nHowever, pool houses serve other purposes as well. From creating space for entertaining to offering an indoor retreat for guests looking for some fun out of the sun, a pool house can be anything from a gracious gathering space to a getaway. Always dreamed of a man-cave or a she-shed? Pool houses are versatile and can do double- or even triple-duty.\n\nA pool house can even create sought-after additional living space. If you want a guest room but don’t have the square footage in your home or the ability to add on, turning a pool house into a guest house is a wonderful alternative.\n\nThe Perfect Pool House Is Out There\n\nWhen you choose to buy a pool house from Kloter Farms, you’re not just getting an outdoor structure. You’re also getting our dedicated partnership in helping you create and bring to life your vision for your ideal poolside retreat.\n\nThis starts with extensive personalization options. From appearance to amenities, all of our durable outdoor structures can be customized to your precise specifications. Not sure what you want or need in a pool house? Whether you have a question about pool house costs or you’re looking for pool house ideas, we’re ready to address your concerns and help you make the most informed decisions.\n\nThe Kloter Farms team will work with you to articulate your vision. Then, we’ll build it for you – keeping you in the loop every step of the way. We’ll even deliver your pool house to your door fully made and ready for use. When we say it couldn’t be easier to customize a pool house with Kloter Farms, we mean it!\n\nEnjoy Complete Control with Your Pool House Customization\n\nDreaming of a quaint poolside cottage for guests? How about a spacious pavilion to complement your outdoor kitchen? At Kloter Farms, we will take your pool house ideas and create a beautiful, functional solution that meets your needs. We offer a wide selection of custom pool houses, including our Classic Pool House, Imperial Pool House, and Elite Pool House. Don’t see a design that strikes your fancy?

A pergola is an open-air type product that is meant to be primarily ornamental but can have an EZShade canopy installed to provide some relief from the elements such as rain or sun. A pergola is a great accent piece on a patio, while a gazebo is much more of a stand-alone structure.\n\nWhat is the best material for a gazebo?\n\nThere are a number of materials that are best for a gazebo. Vinyl is a maintenance-free option, but wood offers a more traditional New England look, with several stain colors available. Often times style and need will determine the best material for a gazebo.\n\nWhy buy a gazebo?\n\nA good reason to buy a gazebo is that a gazebo offers a nice place to enjoy dining, reading a book, or just a nice retreat to an outdoor area.\n\nGazebos\nGazebos\nGreenhouses\nImperial Pool Houses\nSunrooms & Screen Rooms\nPergolas & Pavilions\nPlease Visit Our Store, Call or Email\n\nWe're here to help!\n\nGET DIRECTIONS CALL 860-375-1021 EMAIL US\n \nSign Up for Sales & Events\n\nSubscribe to our emails for the latest news and upcoming sales & events.\n\n860.871.1048\n\n216 West Road, PO Box 440\n\nEllington, CT 06029\n\n(Corner of Route 83 & 286)\n\nFacebook\n \nInstagram\n \nPinterest\n \nYouTube\nStore Hours\nMonday\n9am - 6pm\nTuesday\n9am - 7pm\nWednesday\n9am - 6pm\nThursday\n9am - 7pm\nFriday\n9am - 5pm\nSaturday\n8am - 5pm\nSunday\nClosed\nCustomer Service\nMy Account\nGift Cards\nFinancing\nDelivery & Pick-up\nView Catalog\nContact Us\nKloter Farms\nOur Story\nReviews\nCareers\nPhoto Gallery\nKloter Farms Blog\nDirections\nGoogle Rating\n4.8\nBased on 478 reviews\nGoogle Rating\n4.8\nBased on 478 reviews"

They supported and worked with us making adjustments to design, and were efficient, knowledgeable, and neat during install. We couldn’t be happier!\nKim Hall\n3 months ago\nMy experience with Kloter Farms was superb. I worked with Scott to get the pergola to be exactly the size and way that I wanted it. He was extremely accommodating. The 2 brothers Micah and Moses that came out to install it were excellent and they even worked tirelessly in the rain to complete the project. I am extremely impressed with the service from Kloter Farms.Kim Hall\nJerry Vernazza\n5 months ago\nThis is now my 2nd structure purchased form Kloter Farms.

Would highly recommend this product!\nJa Kr\n2 years ago\nTheir prices are always pretty good, you could probably find something for a little less if you looked around, but you know you're getting a quality product here, and You know you're getting good customer service with the delivery and installation of anything you buy. We've ordered multiple sheds, swings, and other outdoor products from them and have never been disappointed.Exame of great customer service....We ordered some Adirondack chairs a few years ago, one was available quickly and the other was about 2 weeks on backorder. Instead of waiting they actually delivered each chair separately at no extra charge. No need to do that but it's great customer service.\nTerry Temple\n2 years ago\nWe are repeat furniture customers at Kloter Farms, having recently purchased a set of oak dining room chairs and wooden porch furniture. We have also purchased several unique decorative items. At the time of each purchase we were pleased with the friendly and competent sales and delivery persons and the many high-quality choices available. Last week we received our large Smith Brothers conversation sofa after a long, but not unexpected, wait since it was a custom-made piece. We are most happy with it, from style to workmanship and fitting with our decor. The delivery process was easy. We are most happy with Kloter Farms for choices in high-quality items, competent salespersons, and customer service in general. We have found that Kloter Farms offers high quality at competitive prices.\nAnthony Morgante\n3 years ago\nThey exceed expectations in every way. Service, price, delivery...\nlarry deburro\n4 years ago\nExcellent experience with all involved from the sales staff to the delivery crew. Very pleased with the high quality of the chairs and with the price paid.\nDenise Ob\n4 years ago\nCouldn't be happier with our new Glider swing and the excellent service we received from the folks at Kloter Farms. Such nice folks and great service and delivery. Highly recommend!\nAndrew Schur\n5 years ago\nFirst trip to Kloter farms, our interest was mostly furniture and we were not disappointed. The furniture is all very nice and the quality and price are proportionate and fair. I wish we visited Kloter before we furnished our home. While there of course we checked out all the buildings. Everything is very nice, made well and priced fair. It’s so easy to walk around and imagine your dream patio, shed, garage, out building, man cave or she shed. We will definitely be back.\nLaurie Brandner\n9 years ago\nI would highly recommend Kloter Farms! We purchased a pergola and the all weather adirondack chairs. After years of staying outside all year round, they still look like new! We would not hesitate to purchase any of the high quality products from the pleasant people there.\nMichelle Miles\n11 years ago\nWe received our shed today. After looking at the big box hardware stores and other local places that sell sheds, we found the best quality for the money at Kloter Farms. It is worth the drive. The customer service was excellent. Our shed arrived on time, and the delivery crew was courteous and efficient. The shed exceeded our expectation, a solidly built structure, and the site work was also done far better than we could have done ourselves.Every time we visit their Ellington location, we find more things we love! They also sell custom made indoor furniture, kitchen islands and patio furniture.\nJoseph Horner\n12 years ago\nWhen my wife first informed me that she found an outdoor patio set at a convention I did not think much of it. Then she explained, it was $$$$. At first I was about to tell her, take it all back. When it was delivered I could not believe just how well it was made. You could tell there was massive amounts of time and effort put into the design. Materials are above average on so many levels. Customization of the materials, colors, and overall look are also such a huge plus. You know you are not getting something built on an assembly line but custom handcrafted items. It has been 4 years and this patio set is still looking brand new. Simply impressive.I decided to look into outdoor sheds and again, the quality of their produce is top notch. Steel reinforced doors, vinyl windows, and vinyl siding. High grade exterior lumber and plywood and craftsmanship are just impressive. The truth is, you get what you pay for. Their prices are high compared to most companies, but I do not expect to ever have to purchase these items again so how can that be beat? I encourage any one looking for outdoor buildings or furniture to check out Kloter Farms. Service, quality and craftsmanship cannot be beat.\n\nOutdoor Furniture\n\nHandcrafted from poly or wood\nYou furnish the inside of your home with high-quality furniture – why do anything less outside?

Poly furniture has UV inhibitors in the formulation to extend the life of the colors. Even treated wood will fade in a few short years, making poly the preferred outdoor furniture choice to avoid fading.\n\nShould I store away outdoor furniture in the winter?\n\nWhile it is not required to store away outdoor furniture in the winter, it makes for easier spring cleaning if it is at least covered and not subjected to harsh weather.\n\nWhat types of poly furniture are best sellers?\n\nBy far, Adirondack chairs are the number one best seller for poly furniture, followed by dining sets, and accent tables.\n\nWhat is the most durable outdoor furniture?\n\nMany pieces of outdoor furniture are constructed of wood or metal, but generally speaking one of the most durable outdoor furniture and long lasting materials used in outdoor furniture is poly or poly wood.\n\nWhat is the best quality outdoor furniture?\n\nA piece of furniture is only as good as the way that it is built. The best quality outdoor furniture is constructed with outdoor resistant materials such as stainless steel and poly wood and assembled using techniques that have been known to stand the tests of time.\n\nHow should I arrange my outdoor furniture?\n\nTo maximize the usage of your outdoor space, consider arranging your outdoor furniture in a manner that would mimic the most used spaces inside your home. Think about how the space that you are trying to furnish will first function (ie: dining, living, poolside lounging, etc) and then the way you desire it to flow.\n\nPatio Furniture\nPoly Dining Sets\nSeats 2 People\nSeats 4 People\nSeats 6 People\nSeats 8 People\nDining Height Sets\nCounter & Bar Height Sets\nSquare & Rectangle Sets\nRound & Oval Sets\nTables Only\nChairs & Benches Only\nAdirondack Chairs\nOutdoor Cushioned Furniture\nClassic Terrace Poly Collection\nNordic Premium Poly Collection\nWicker Furniture Collection\nShop Outdoor Collections\nIsland Poly Collection\nLeisure Poly Collection\nClassic Terrace Poly Collection\nNordic Premium Poly Collection\nWicker Furniture Collection\nOutdoor Wooden Furniture\nPorch Rockers & Gliders\nOutdoor Swings & Benches\nOutdoor Bars & Barstools\nGarden Bridges\nBBQ Equipment & Supplies\nPlease Visit Our Store, Call or Email\n\nWe're here to help!\n\nGET DIRECTIONS CALL 860-375-1021 EMAIL US\n \nSign Up for Sales & Events\n\nSubscribe to our emails for the latest news and upcoming sales & events.\n\n860.871.1048\n\n216 West Road, PO Box 440\n\nEllington, CT 06029\n\n(Corner of Route 83 & 286)\n\nFacebook\n \nInstagram\n \nPinterest\n \nYouTube\nStore Hours\nMonday\n9am - 6pm\nTuesday\n9am - 7pm\nWednesday\n9am - 6pm\nThursday\n9am - 7pm\nFriday\n9am - 5pm\nSaturday\n8am - 5pm\nSunday\nClosed\nCustomer Service\nMy Account\nGift Cards\nFinancing\nDelivery & Pick-up\nView Catalog\nContact Us\nKloter Farms\nOur Story\nReviews\nCareers\nPhoto Gallery\nKloter Farms Blog\nDirections\nGoogle Rating\n4.8\nBased on 478 reviews\nGoogle Rating\n4.8\nBased on 478 reviews"

Selecting or customizing solid wood American made stools from a reputable source that work within the style of your space is a great place to start.\n\nHow tall should kitchen island chairs be?\n\nKitchen island chairs generally come in two heights. Counter chairs are typically paired with surfaces that are usually around 36” high while bar chairs are paired with surfaces that are around 42” high.\n\nWhy should I replace my kitchen table with a kitchen island?\n\nWhen you find that your kitchen island or kitchen table no longer serve the needs of your family or space, the time has come to replace them. Sometimes a growing family or home remodel may dictate that decision, while other times the lack of storage or prep space may be the deciding factor to replace your current furniture.\n\nKitchen & Dining\nTables & Chairs\nCustom Tables\nArm & Side Chairs\nBenches\nCounter Chairs & Stools\nDining Collections\nAcadia Collection\nAsher Collection\nAshlyn Collection\nBellport Collection\nBerkeley Collection\nBranson Benson Collection\nBranson Braxton Collection\nBranson Brighton Collection\nBranson Brogan Collection\nBranson Callahan Collection\nBranson Dunmore Collection\nBranson Edison Collection\nBranson Farmhouse Collection\nBranson Hadley Collection\nBranson Hayward Collection\nBranson Kingsbury Collection\nBranson Kinsley Collection\nBranson Stonehill Collection\nBranson Wrought Iron Collection\nBurnet Collection\nCentury Collection\nCharlotte Collection\nConcord Collection\nDalton Collection\nEllwood Collection\nFairbanks Collection\nHaley Collection\nMilan Collection\nMission Collection\nRedmond Collection\nRidgefield Collection\nRocklin Mills Collection\nRowan Collection\nRyker Double Pedestal Collection\nRyker Single Pedestal Collection\nSag Harbor Collection\nSconset Collection\nSouthport Leg Collection\nSouthport Single Pedestal Collection\nStonewall Collection\nVandalia Collection\nVenice Collection\nVineyard Haven Collection\nWhiskey Barrel Pub\nBradford Series\nBradford Tables\nBradford Chairs\nBradford Benches\nBradford Counter Chairs & Stools\nBradford Dining Collections\nAsher Collection\nAshlyn Collection\nBellport Collection\nBerkeley Collection\nCharlotte Collection\nRidgefield Collection\nBranson Series\nBranson Tables\nBranson Chairs\nBranson Benches\nBranson Counter Chairs & Stools\nBranson Dining Collections\nBranson Benson Collection\nBranson Braxton Collection\nBranson Brighton Collection\nBranson Brogan Collection\nBranson Callahan Collection\nBranson Dunmore Collection\nBranson Edison Collection\nBranson Farmhouse Collection\nBranson Hadley Collection\nBranson Hayward Collection\nBranson Kingsbury Collection\nBranson Kinsley Collection\nBranson Stonehill Collection\nBranson Wrought Iron Collection\nCandor Designs Series\nCandor Designs Tables\nCandor Designs Chairs\nCandor Designs Benches\nCandor Designs Counter Chairs & Stools\nCandor Designs Dining Collections\nMission Collection\nRedmond Collection\nRowan Collection\nRyker Double Pedestal Collection\nRyker Single Pedestal Collection\nSouthport Leg Collection\nSouthport Single Pedestal Collection\nStonewall Collection\nVandalia Collection\nVineyard Haven Collection\nEastford Plains Series\nEastford Plains Tables\nEastford Plains Chairs\nEastford Plains Benches\nEastford Plains Counter Chairs & Stools\nEastford Plains Dining Collections\nAcadia Collection\nBurnet Collection\nConcord Collection\nEllwood Collection\nFairbanks Collection\nHaley Collection\nMilan Collection\nRocklin Mills Collections\nSag Harbor Collection\nSconset Collection\nBarstools & Counter Chairs\nKitchen Islands\n30\" - 35\" Long Islands\n45\" - 60\" Long Islands\n60\"+ Long Islands\nBest Sellers\nDesigner Series Islands\nIslands with Closed Bases\nIslands with Legs/Feet\nShop All Kitchen Islands\nBrowse Kitchen Islands\nCustom Kitchen Cabinets\nSideboards & Bar Cabinets\nHutches\n2-Door Hutches\n3-Door Hutches\n4-Door Hutches\nCorner Hutches\nVanity & Laundry Custom Cabinets\nBuilt-In Vanity Cabinets\nStand Alone Vanities\nCabin Hill Vanities\nCamden Vanities\nCharleston Vanities\nChloe Vanities\nTopeka Vanities\nStorage Cabinets & Curios\nPlease Visit Our Store, Call or Email\n\nWe're here to help!\n\nGET DIRECTIONS CALL 860-375-1008 EMAIL US\n \nSign Up for Sales & Events\n\nSubscribe to our emails for the latest news and upcoming sales & events.\n\n860.871.1048\n\n216 West Road, PO Box 440\n\nEllington, CT 06029\n\n(Corner of Route 83 & 286)\n\nFacebook\n \nInstagram\n \nPinterest\n \nYouTube\nStore Hours\nMonday\n9am - 6pm\nTuesday\n9am - 7pm\nWednesday\n9am - 6pm\nThursday\n9am - 7pm\nFriday\n9am - 5pm\nSaturday\n8am - 5pm\nSunday\nClosed\nCustomer Service\nMy Account\nGift Cards\nFinancing\nDelivery & Pick-up\nView Catalog\nContact Us\nKloter Farms\nOur Story\nReviews\nCareers\nPhoto Gallery\nKloter Farms Blog\nDirections\nGoogle Rating\n4.8\nBased on 478 reviews\nGoogle Rating\n4.8\nBased on 478 reviews"

Great business.\nRoseann Belanger\na year ago\nFrom start to finish everything went according to plan. Stephen and his crew are very knowledgeable and were easy to work with. The finished product came out beautiful.\nSimi Capano\na year ago\nI took a drive to Kloter Farms last weekend...hour and a half from Stamford. Beautiful drive through rural Connecticut. I visited the two stores, this one, and the one with the kitchen islands and full kitchens. I ordered a kitchen island and chairs. Everything is customized. I am happy with the price and probably would have cost much more if I shopped in Lower Fairfield County or Westchester Country. Thank you Sierra for your patience and expertise. Delivery takes several months, so I'm glad I decided to order now. Can't wait to see the final product.\nEric Elman\na year ago\n10/10. Yes, A+++. Steve and his team were exceptional to work with. Steve is down to earth, a straight shooter, right to the point, and his knowledge level is seemingly beyond his years. His crew was professional and courteous at every step of the way. Cabinets, well they are fully custom and when you compare woods used, thickness, joinery, hardware and finish they cannot be beat by anyone - and we did our due diligence. One of the major differences with Kloter kitchens is that the team that designs the kitchen, is the same team that installs the kitchen. Unlike other companies, they also provide a firm install date shortly after the contract is signed. Sure enough, the install took place on the day promised and they sized the install crew to get the job done in one day. Sure, a couple of small details needed tending to after the install, but they were back just as promised. Dan, their repair man was also prompt, courteous and very knowledgable taking care of the few details to our satisfaction. I am very particular and have high expectations - Kloter met, and exceeded them in some cases. Very highly recommended.\nPatricia Broskey\na year ago\nStephen helped make our dreams come true! From design to construction we could not have been happier. Stephen makes sure the function works and provides all the thoughtful ideas to add additional efficiency. We love the quality of the cabinets as much as the look. Kloter farms was exceptional to work with!! If you are looking for a new kitchen definitely go visit… you will not be disappointed!\nleah gerber\na year ago\nOur kitchen experience with Kloter Farms was perfect and seamless. From the design, the install, the finishing touches, and the photos we are more than pleased with the outcome. We were remodeling an older home and Kloter Farms was able to design everything we were looking for in a small layout! We can’t rave about their team enough! Thank you!\nDenise Egan\na year ago\nWorking with Stephen and his team on my beautiful kitchen was a pleasure from start to finish. They go over and beyond to deliver everything promised and more. The quality of the cabinets is exceptional. Thank you!\nLaura Byers\na year ago\nI am extremely happy with our kitchen remodel and the quality of the kitchen cabinets. The staff were professional, courteous and easy to work with. I would definitely recommend Kloter Farms.\nLee DesRoches\na year ago\nWe visited 3 custom cabinet makers in CT before settling on Kloter Farms. Our kitchen is pretty small and was not a very good use of space. Stephen was able to make subtle changes to our kitchen layout that made our small space more usable with a more spacious feeling. We are able to utilize more storage in our new kitchen and we don't constantly bump into each other when cooking and prepping our meals.Even if you are a handy person, I would recommend having Kloter Farms do the cabinet installation because they are not just professional as the label goes, they truly are top notch and get the job done quickly. Things like uneven floors and walls are taken into account so your cabinets look as if they were built with your house without unsightly gaps. They even take into account small details like floor tile grout channels, making it look like the cabinet is “melted” to the floor. Hard to beat that kind of quality work and the installation price is not that bad considering they come in with a crew on a mission to get your kitchen up and running as soon and efficiently as possible.All time frames were met as discussed months prior during the project planning phase, no disappointing delays or cancellations, thoroughly professional. Stephen is also good at giving design advice based on what look you are going for. Once you communicate what you want, he will make the best suggestions based on your needs. He is very responsive during the the entire process, from selection to planning, to post install, making you feel reassured whenever you have a question or need advice.The cabinets are high quality and seem very durable. We went with stained cabinets and the wood is smoother than I have seen on any cabinets. The protective finish is also a nice touch and all hardware like slides and internal organizers are of the highest quality, think trade sourced quality, not things you can find in your local home improvement store. We even had a cabinet tech as part of our installation who filled nail holes and matched the colors perfectly as well as “fine tune” all the doors and drawers so they work flawlessly.A truly great experience for our remodel and we are very happy with the layout changes, cabinets, and service we received from Kloter Farms!\nBill\n2 years ago\nKloter Farms is the place to go if you are looking for the highest quality kitchen cabinets and expert carpenters to install them! We chose Kloter Farms to replace our 45-year-old kitchen. We received excellent service at every step of the process, from designing the new layout, selecting the best style and finishes, and though the installation process. The quality of the cabinets was only matched by the skillful carpentry and attention to detail of Stephen and his installation team. Our kitchen ceiling, walls and floor are very crooked. Stephen expertly scribed and shimmed the cabinets and moldings to correct for our kitchen’s unevenness. We are extremely pleased with our new custom kitchen and have received many compliments from family and friends. Thank you very much Kloter Farms!!!\nKitchen Cabinetry FAQs\nHow do I choose the right wood for my kitchen cabinets?\n\nAt Kloter Farms, we offer several wood varieties for our handcrafted kitchen cabinets, including oak, maple, cherry,  hickory, and more.

Kitchens are uniquely personal spaces. Want to make the most of yours? Custom kitchen design cabinetry will bring your exact vision to life.\n\nImproved Efficiency and Productivity\n\nWhether you’re an accomplished home chef or your microwave is your best friend, custom kitchen cabinets can help you maximize the time you spend prepping, cooking, and cleaning up. From optimizing your kitchen layout to incorporating time-saving features, there are many changes you can make that will streamline and improve how you use your kitchen.\n\nFulfilling Your Aesthetic Vision\n\nJust because functionality is important in a kitchen design doesn’t mean you have to sacrifice form. When you upgrade to a farm kitchen cabinet or another style from Kloter Farms, you add an element of timeless elegance to your environment. However, our handcrafted kitchen cabinets aren’t just beautiful; they’re also a testament to time-honored design and craftsmanship.\n\nMaximizing Your Space\n\nSpace is one of a homeowner’s most precious commodities. In addition to helping you create flow, custom kitchens also add space. For example, incorporating a kitchen island with cabinets creates storage and another counter for prep and cooking.

Not to mention that you spend a lot of time in yours – so shouldn’t it be the warm and welcoming environment of your dreams?

Greta store, great staff, we will definitely be back for more!\nSusan Chambers\na month ago\nWe tried recliner chairs. Mary asked if we needed help. I advised her that I had compressed discs in my neck. It was a huge sale day but Mary said she wanted to make sure I got the correct chair for my needs. We tried 4 chairs and she checked my shoulder neck and arms. She had me resit in certain chairs. We totally had 100% focus and customer service. Made sure the chair could be customized to what I needed. Mary then helped us by asking the colors in the room and brought samples to me. The absolute best customer service I have had in my life. Class furniture and sales representatives.\nDonna Slora\na month ago\nTim and Ben were very professional .Called when they were 10 minutes away.Delivered my sectional with no problems.

We were enthusiastically greeted by Emily when we arrived, she turned us over to Edwin, who is knowledgeable and helpful. Our lovely sofa and cushions were delivered by Tim and Ben.

Nothing in the local furniture stores or on-line came even close to the quality and colors of their leathers (and I upholster furniture),the variety of styles,the impeccable service from the day we walked in to look around to the final on-time delivery. Could not be happier, it is perfect and well worth the price!\nCarol Barry\n4 months ago\nI purchased a recliner not long ago. The chair is comfortable and fits nicely in our living room.

Although the structure and stitching were of the finest quality, we were unhappy with the stuffing. I called Steve at the store and immediately a staff member was sent to the house who made some minor adjustments. We couldn’t be happier! We also were given the assurance that they would come back in the future if there needed to be any adjustments. Steve assured me that the store’s customers are their top priority. It is a relief to find that Kloter farms takes pride in the craft of their furniture unlike many of the area furniture stores. We were so pleased with the experience that we also bought a desk there. I would definitely recommend this store\nRoger Tapke\n6 months ago\nWe found exactly the chair we wanted. It arrived 2 weeks before the estimate and is extremely well made and super comfortable.

I feel so good about my purchase from Kloter Farms!\nJames Brushitis\n7 months ago\nWe visited Kloter Farms the day after Thanksgiving and were pleasantly surprised at the beautiful living room furniture and the custom fabrics that were available.

Thank you to all.\nNoreen Quinn\na year ago\nIt was a wonderful experience from start to finish. This kind of customer service is hard to find.

I’d recommend Kloters to anyone looking for well made beautiful furniture!!!\nCharles Cappannari\n2 years ago\nWe tested the patience of the home furnishings department sales staff with our many visits to the store. We were refurnishing our lining room in our smaller condo so we had to get just the right sofa, 2 reclining chairs, and TV console. The Noah and Cathy among others cordially guided us through our choices of design, fabric, firmness, color, and coordination. Their patience and knowledge paid off as we now have a completely new lining room! On delivery day Kevin and Dominick were very helpful in moving the old furniture and setting the new pieces in place. They then explained how to care for our new fabrics and wood finish on the console. The sofa and chairs are firm and comfortable as we expected and the console looks great.

Last week we received our large Smith Brothers conversation sofa after a long, but not unexpected, wait since it was a custom-made piece. We are most happy with it, from style to workmanship and fitting with our decor. The delivery process was easy.

As you can see from the photos, our kitty approves too.\nbonnie han\n3 years ago\nI love my new leather sofa recliner. I have waited a few years to get it and now it’s going to be much easier to take care of since I’ve had my little dog. It fits in great where I had my previous sofa. The help I had in choosing it was great, as were the men who delivered it. Great service and great quality!\nTracey Hannan\n3 years ago\nWe purchased a couch on thanksgiving weekend and it arrived today. I couldn’t be happier. The service and helpfulness of the people at Kloter Farms were excellent, as always. Kathy was extremely helpful with picking out the colors. And the men that delivered the couch were fantastic. I didn’t catch their names but you wouldn’t have even known they were here. They were cautious, courteous and super careful. White glove service for sure. I highly recommend Kloter Farms. Love the store.\nMark Homan\n3 years ago\nBack in October, we ordered a pair of recliner rockers. Great assistance in selecting fabric and chair options once we narrowed it down to a specific chair. They warned manufacturers were taking a while to assemble and import from Canada.Chairs arrived today. Delivery was fast. Scheduled two days after initial call that chairs were in. Delivery was about 45 minutes before window. So not too early, but nicely early. They got to the house as expected when they called ahead. Took about 10 minutes to get furniture in, set up and answer my questions. That was fast.Pleased with chairs so far.\n\nFor many, family and living rooms are a place where people can come together to enjoy each other’s company.

Most living rooms contain various upholstered pieces to sit or recline in, but don’t forget the accent tables such as coffee tables, end tables or a TV stand.\n\nWhat should be the focal point of my living room?\n\nOften a fireplace mantle or large window or piece of artwork can serve as a focal point to a living room, but why not a custom piece of furniture? Custom accent walls containing built-in libraries or other accent pieces are also options to draw the eye around the room.\n\nLiving Room Furniture\nSofas Sectionals Chairs\nSofas\nSectionals\nChairs\nOttomans\nShop Styles\nSmith Brothers Collection\nSmith Brothers Sofas\nSmith Brothers Sectionals\nSmith Brothers Chairs\nSmith Brothers Ottomans\nShop Smith Brothers Styles\n209 Style\n227 Style\n234 Style\n235 Style\n249 Style\n256 Style\n263 Style\n268 Style\n280 Style\n284 Style\n3000 Style\n366 Style\n374 Style\n383 Style\n393 Style\n396 Style\n397 Style\n5000 Style\n506 Style\n517 Style\n522 Style\n526 Style\n527 Style\n530 Style\n560 Style\n568 Style\n8000 Style\n825 Style\n9000 Style\n933 Style\nShop Smith Brothers Best Sellers\nElran Collection\nElran Sofas\nElran Sectionals\nElran Chairs & Recliners\nShop Elran Styles\n6000 Series Style\nKellan Style\nLance Style\nLillian Style\nPower 7000 Style\nRebecca Style\nUno Style\nCraftsman Collection\nAccent Tables\nEnd Tables\nCoffee Tables\nSofa Tables\nHall Tables\nShop By Style\nAshford Collection\nAlpine Collection\nBranson Alden Collection\nBranson Farmhouse Collection\nBrooklyn Collection\nCabin Hill Collection\nCamden Collection\nCandes Collection\nCarson Collection\nColonial Pine Collection\nConway Collection\nCrossway Collection\nGarner Collection\nGeneva Live Edge Collection\nHomestead Collection\nLangdon Collection\nLogan Collection\nMadison Heights Collection\nMcCoy Collection\nMillington Collection\nMission Collection\nMission Prairie Collection\nMontauk Collection\nNewport Collection\nOlde Shaker Collection\nRiley Collection\nSimplicity Collection\nSofia Collection\nSomerset Collection\nSpring Hill Collection\nValencia Collection\nEntertainment Centers\nTV Consoles\nWall Units\nCorner Units\nCustom Entertainment Centers\nMedia Cabinets\nRockers & Gliders\nCurios\nPlease Visit Our Store, Call or Email\n\nWe're here to help!\n\nGET DIRECTIONS CALL 860-375-1008 EMAIL US\n \nSign Up for Sales & Events\n\nSubscribe to our emails for the latest news and upcoming sales & events.\n\n860.871.1048\n\n216 West Road, PO Box 440\n\nEllington, CT 06029\n\n(Corner of Route 83 & 286)\n\nFacebook\n \nInstagram\n \nPinterest\n \nYouTube\nStore Hours\nMonday\n9am - 6pm\nTuesday\n9am - 7pm\nWednesday\n9am - 6pm\nThursday\n9am - 7pm\nFriday\n9am - 5pm\nSaturday\n8am - 5pm\nSunday\nClosed\nCustomer Service\nMy Account\nGift Cards\nFinancing\nDelivery & Pick-up\nView Catalog\nContact Us\nKloter Farms\nOur Story\nReviews\nCareers\nPhoto Gallery\nKloter Farms Blog\nDirections\nGoogle Rating\n4.8\nBased on 478 reviews\nGoogle Rating\n4.8\nBased on 478 reviews"

Just let us know! Call 860-375-1008.\n\nQ&A\nWhere is the best placement for a wall bed?\n\nAlmost any wall will work for the placement of a wall bed though there are a couple of things to keep in mind. The two things that you will need to consider when selecting a wall are the natural flow of the room so that you don’t create a blockage as well as making sure that you have enough length to accommodate the entire unit.\n\nWhat bedroom sets are in style?\n\nWhile the style of your bedroom furniture is most certainly a personal opinion, you want to be sure that it blends well in your home’s space and overall feel. Generally speaking Mid-Century, Modern, as well as Farmhouse bedroom sets are some of the most trendy styles that we are observing.\n\nHow do I get more storage in my bedroom?\n\nStorage is everyone’s friend as well as a huge priority in most people’s bedrooms. To gain more storage in your existing bedroom, consider storage beds, armoires or even taller dressers or bureaus that have more and larger drawers.\n\nBedroom Furniture\nBedroom Suites\nAmherst Suite\nArden Suite\nBluff Pointe Suite\nBryant Suite\nCabin Hill Suite\nChatham Suite\nChloe Suite\nColebrook Suite\nDuncan Suite\nEllison Suite\nElridge Suite\nEmerson Suite\nFabric Beds\nFarmington Suite\nHampshire Suite\nHarper Bay Suite\nHayden Valley Suite\nHuntington Suite\nKinsley Suite\nLansing Suite\nLyra Suite\nMillard Suite\nNewcastle Suite\nRainier Suite\nRaleigh Suite\nRochelle Suite\nSierra Mission Suite\nSofia Suite\nSydney Suite\nTrumbull Suite\nTucker Suite\nUrbana Suite\nWilton Suite\nYasmin Suite\nBeds Only\nWall Beds\nStandard Wall Beds\nCube Wall Beds\nDesk Wall Beds\nSide Units\nMattresses\nComfort Level\nExtra Firm\nFirm\nPlush\nExtra Plush\nFeatures\nAdjustable Base Friendly\n100% Organic\nNatural Latex\nFlippable\nCooling\nSplit Comfort Levels\nType\nBest Sellers\nAdjustable Base\nWrapped Coils\nInnerspring\nFoam Core\nUpholstered Accent Chairs\nPlease Visit Our Store, Call or Email\n\nWe're here to help!\n\nGET DIRECTIONS CALL 860-375-1008 EMAIL US\n \nSign Up for Sales & Events\n\nSubscribe to our emails for the latest news and upcoming sales & events.\n\n860.871.1048\n\n216 West Road, PO Box 440\n\nEllington, CT 06029\n\n(Corner of Route 83 & 286)\n\nFacebook\n \nInstagram\n \nPinterest\n \nYouTube\nStore Hours\nMonday\n9am - 6pm\nTuesday\n9am - 7pm\nWednesday\n9am - 6pm\nThursday\n9am - 7pm\nFriday\n9am - 5pm\nSaturday\n8am - 5pm\nSunday\nClosed\nCustomer Service\nMy Account\nGift Cards\nFinancing\nDelivery & Pick-up\nView Catalog\nContact Us\nKloter Farms\nOur Story\nReviews\nCareers\nPhoto Gallery\nKloter Farms Blog\nDirections\nGoogle Rating\n4.8\nBased on 478 reviews\nGoogle Rating\n4.8\nBased on 478 reviews"

The desk is so well made and of the highest workmanship. There was a half inch clearance to get it thru the door into our study. Kloter delivery people were awesome and took the top off the desk and the door to the room off the hinges to get it in. Neither the desk nor the woodwork were damaged at all. They were so accommodating. Highly recommend Kloter Farms.\nDarlene Coolong\n3 years ago\nContacted Kloter Farms as they were the only furniture supplier I found that had both a style that would match our existing decor and allowed me to select the type of wood, finish color, and hardware.

From the sales process to the site prep and then delivery it was professional and seamless. I've had the shed a couple months now and I couldn't be happier! The outdoor equipment is happy too😀\nSusan Chambers\na month ago\nWe tried recliner chairs. Mary asked if we needed help. I advised her that I had compressed discs in my neck. It was a huge sale day but Mary said she wanted to make sure I got the correct chair for my needs. We tried 4 chairs and she checked my shoulder neck and arms. She had me resit in certain chairs. We totally had 100% focus and customer service. Made sure the chair could be customized to what I needed. Mary then helped us by asking the colors in the room and brought samples to me. The absolute best customer service I have had in my life. Class furniture and sales representatives.\nMerri Scarbrough\na month ago\nKloter Farms is fantastic! From the start of our journey of purchasing a shed to the actual delivery - which was very challenging to put the shed in the tight area it had to go - amazing journey! I would definitely recommend them on all their options, pricing and quality. THANK YOU!\nLena Garcia\na month ago\nWe ordered one shed from Kloter and had such a fantastic experience we ordered a second!

Explained how to clean and take apart if needed.Carl our salesperson was excellent in helping us differentiate each sectional and explaining options ,fabric choices etc.\nMark Wilson\na month ago\nWorking with Kloter Farms is without a doubt one of the best experiences in retail. Their willingness to find the right shed at the right price was most noteworthy. Everything from the purchase, site prep, and delivery was professional and well communicated. Steve went above and beyond with the site prep and I learned that \"level\" and \"flat\" are not the same thing. Delivery was a site to behold - Dan got the shed on the pad within an 1/8 inch of dead center and was willing to spend as much time getting it right as needed. I cannot say enough about this company and the experience!\nLinda B\na month ago\nHugh Anderson\na month ago\nWe had a great experience with Kloter Farms.

We purchased a shed from Kloter Farms and could not be more pleased with the service and quality of the product. Our salesperson, Kim M, was an absolute delight to work with. She took videos and pictures of the shed we were interested in and shared a ton of info which gave us the comfort to buy it without going to the showroom. Moreover, the delivery team (Dillon and Ron) were equally amazing. Very nice guys and extremely skilled. I was impressed how they were able to get the shed to the exact spot I needed within a tight space.What’s next?

If I could give 10 stars, I would! Every worker coming to our house was great and the finished barn is everything we thought it would be and more. We have a Kloter Farm shed we purchased 26 years ago that is still standing and in great shape so we know the larger structure will be just as solid.

Their showroom contained a huge variety of styles and materials, and we were thrilled to be able to design our own contemporary pieces with the help of wonderful Noah Welti.

We couldn’t be happier!\nMichael Jalbert\n2 months ago\nIts like that old Rolling Rock Beer slogan, \"Same as it always was\". We purchased our first Kloter Farms shed twenty two years for our home in CT. It was one of the more memorable and pleasurable home improvement projects we have experienced. The Kloter Farms staff was professional/courteous and accommodating. The shed was of great quality, workmanship, and competitively priced. We recently purchased our second Kloter Farms shed for our retirement home in RI. From the selection and sale process with Amy to the delivery and installation process with Christian it was the same as it always was.

A great experience for us from start to finish.\nPenny Lebel\n3 months ago\nThis is our second out building from Kloter. This one is my “cottage “. With Nicks help, I was able to get everything that I envisioned. From the size of the building to the amount of windows that I wanted and the doors I wanted as well. The site preparation was meticulously accomplished by their contractor. On delivery day I was in awe when I saw the truck coming down my street. It’s beautiful, I am so happy.

Nothing in the local furniture stores or on-line came even close to the quality and colors of their leathers (and I upholster furniture),the variety of styles,the impeccable service from the day we walked in to look around to the final on-time delivery. Could not be happier, it is perfect and well worth the price!\nCarol Barry\n4 months ago\nI purchased a recliner not long ago. The chair is comfortable and fits nicely in our living room.

Always a pleasant shopping experience.\nDan Griffin\n4 months ago\nCalled kloters because I needed my Kloter sheds moved to my new residence as we had moved.They came out and scoped it out as it was a tight fit to remove the sheds .I have to say I was very impressed with those trailers and their ability to minipulate them to get the job done. It was a task but they handled it with ease.Professional,courteous, very knowledgeable service .\nMichael Sawicki\n4 months ago\nJust got a new mattress and box spring delivered from Kloter Farms.

Sales personnel, Richard, was most informative and patient in assisting us. Steve and Chris from S&D construction installed the blue stone pad with exceptional skill and results. Today, Chris from Kloter Farms, in spite of an early spring wintry mix, arrived in Springfield from Ellington to skillfully maneuver the shed placement within limited confines. A great team effort from start to finish, and well worth the purchase and then some. Thank you Kloter Farms.\nDorothy Buxton\n4 months ago\nI bought a sofa from kloter farms as well as a table.

The sales people are top notch- professional, skilled, and friendly. My husband and I bought a furniture set there. Although the structure and stitching were of the finest quality, we were unhappy with the stuffing. I called Steve at the store and immediately a staff member was sent to the house who made some minor adjustments. We couldn’t be happier! We also were given the assurance that they would come back in the future if there needed to be any adjustments. Steve assured me that the store’s customers are their top priority. It is a relief to find that Kloter farms takes pride in the craft of their furniture unlike many of the area furniture stores. We were so pleased with the experience that we also bought a desk there. I would definitely recommend this store\nNanny Machado\n5 months ago\nKloter Farms is wonderful. The staff at the store are friendly and knowledgeable. They have great quality furniture.

It’s a beautiful, quality, American made piece at a great value! The manufacturer guarantees the cushions and will replace the foam if needed, which is tremendous. This couch replaces one from a reputable store that did not hold up at all. I feel so good about my purchase from Kloter Farms!\nJames Brushitis\n7 months ago\nWe visited Kloter Farms the day after Thanksgiving and were pleasantly surprised at the beautiful living room furniture and the custom fabrics that were available. We placed an order and just received our family room set today 1/10/24. It arrived in perfect condition and it is so well constructed that we have to tell everyone to go there and if you are in the market for furniture this is the place to go. You won't be disappointed.\nSnookie (Snookie)\n7 months ago\nDecided to go from a rectangle table that I had for years that was handmade to a round table from Klotters farms and matching hutch. I only went with a base because of the room. It is beautiful. I live 45 minutes away now and decided to go down to Kloters. I Got it in less time than expected. Professional nice guys that came in and set it all up and explained how to take care of it. I have used Kloter Farms for years from a sleigh bench, a hall rack with the seat, decorations and so on. Worth every penny for beautiful handmade furniture. Especially during their sales. Very kind professional people that will help you with anything and answer all your questions.\nDavid Crane\n7 months ago\nWe just bought our second relining chair from Kloter. We were so delighted with the first one that that we had to have a second so that now we have his and hers. The company was excellent to do business with.

We found both at Kloter.\nJoy Talotta\n7 months ago\nJust purchased kitchen table and chairs. We were able to get exactly what we wanted in the size and finish as so many custom options.

I highly recommend Kloter Farms and a trip to the store in Ellington CT is well worth the trip. Happy New Year!\nNicole Morosanu\n7 months ago\nKloter farms is a well oiled machine. They are professional, punctual and efficient. The final product is worth the investment. That said, just a couple words of advice if you are inexperienced with these types of builds and the process (like me). First, unless you know who you’re dealing with on the concrete side stick with Kloter and their subcontractors, it will save you time and likely money in the longer run. Second, you do need to ask for a break down of what is to be expected with respect to permits, expectations and time line. That said Kloter’s representatives are responsive and will provide a breakdown of requirements and expectations upon request.\nNina Crapser\n8 months ago\nWe just had a 30 year old gazebo that was purchased originally from Kloter moved from my in-laws to our home & EVERYONE we worked with was awesome! Lisa & Nick in the office helped us navigate the move process & Dan & Bill took this family “heirloom” from Springfield to Stafford flawlessly. The customer service is excellent & so is the craftsmanship on this gazebo. After 30 years it’s still in wonderful shape.\nJeffrey Gebrian\n8 months ago\nWe had heard that Kloter Farms had a good and reliable reputation when we were planning for a new, detached garage. We followed up and visited their premises Fall of 2022. Our experience began with a friendly and professional tour of the facilities by a sales person ending with a close look at a 20' by 20' garage which we knew would fit our tight site. Our questions and comments about budgets and schedule were clearly and professionally answered. From there we decided to go ahead and received the same high level of service from contract to schedule to construction; from the footing, foundation and floor to the building walls, doors and roof. Every single person who worked on every aspect of this garage knew what they were doing and did so in a very courteous, skilled and professional manner. We will highly recommend Kloter Farms. Robin and Jeffrey Gebrian.\ndonna bolasevich\n9 months ago\nWe purchased a couch and table and chairs from Kloter Farms. We love the quality and everything about the experience.

Wonderful from in-store discussion at the start, to delivery at our home.\nKatie Fisher Team\n10 months ago\nWe purchased 2 custom sheds.

We love our Kloter shed/garage and when it came time to sell our home, we wanted to take it with us! They were all amazing!

Friendly, reliable, responsive and skilled!\nRobin Thompson\n11 months ago\nChris & Keenan did a great job delivering and putting our bedroom furniture together.

We couldn't be happier with our choice. I can't recommend Klotter enough, Kim our Saleswoman to Dan who delivered it...top notch service. This shed is solid and won't be going anywhere.I was worried I was going to have to take down a fence panel...nope! Dan fit a 10ft wide shed in a 10 ft 2 inch space\nJoanne Nesbitt\n11 months ago\nKloter Farms is beautiful inside and out! Our sales rep was Paul who we dealt with and couldn't ask for a nicer person. Several calls and emails and always 100% customer service. From the day of purchase to removal of old shed and prep for new shed was outstanding. The delivery of the new shed was amazing. Everything was done perfectly and no issues at all. Nicest group of people from start to finish. 100% satisfied and would always go back again. We are pleased with our new shed and just can't say enough.......perfection!\nKimberly\n11 months ago\nWe cannot say enough good things about Kloter Farms… Every major piece of furniture in our home was purchased there- including a newly installed dream kitchen!

Our experience from start to finish has been exceptional. We are very pleased with the support, delivery, installation and especially the garage itself. Kloter Farms was able to customize our garage to our exact specifications. The end product looks and feels like it has always been a part of our 1940s Cape Cod homestead.\nJohn Sheehy\na year ago\nOne of the best purchase experiences I’ve ever had. From the moment I contacted Kloter Farm about an in stock shed they had until the truck pulled away after delivering it, everything was 10 STARS. Kim in Sales was excellent in every aspect, sending pictures, payment options, site preparation and delivery notifications. Tyler, the delivery genius was a master at his craft, maneuvering the truck and trailer into my back yard to perfectly place the shed. I got the impression he could have done it in his sleep. The shed is beautiful and constructed extremely well. I certainly made the right choice and I would recommend Kloter Farms to anyone who asks.\nMichael Keating\na year ago\nWell, it was a wonderful experience to work with Jason and his team to complete this final phase of a restoration project of an old Victorian home.From start to finish the team helped us in every way.Thank you Jason, John, Kevin (and sons)… can’t leave out delivery and garage door crew.I now have a gazebo, shed and garage. Thanks again. Mike\nLynn Clark\na year ago\nThis is the second time we have gone to Kloter for a structure on our property.The first was a large shed and that experience was very gratifying and we love our little barn. It's too beautiful to be called a shed. This time we went for a two car garage and the experience was amazing. First, Jason Kloter came to our home with a truckful of samples, pictures, ideas, etc. and sat with us for two hours helping us design the garage. It is now up and looks fabulous. The team that built the foundation and redesigned the driveway as well as the team that assembled the garage were excellent. We cannot thank you all enough.\nDavid Ascenza Sr\na year ago\nKloter Farms is an amazing shopping experience, the staff is professional, knowledgeable as well as friendly. We were looking for a glass top dining table for our kitchen and we were informed they didn’t have anything with a glass top. The sales associate Steve ended up talking to the manager and they custom built one which now is available in their line up. Delivery was on time and placed in our home with care. If I could give Kloter Farms more than five stars in this review I would. Many thanks…Dave & Donna Ascenza\nJohnny O\na year ago\nWe are extremely pleased with the garage Kloter Farms built for us and the service they provided from start to finish. Bottom line: If we had to do it all over, we would use Kloter Farms again without a second thought.I grew up in a family of skilled and perfectionist craftsmen. Matt and his build crew are cut from the same cloth. From the very beginning, Matt's client service and communication were top notch. We worked through all the planning together and his experience was invaluable in helping us develop a customized plan to suit our needs and budget. Matt remained hands-on during critical phases of construction, working alongside the build team to ensure perfect fit and finish. And the build team, led by J & R, were incredible too. I have not seen harder working or more skilled tradesmen. The product itself is of superior build. No skimping on construction methods and materials...actually better than stick-built in several ways. Finally, they never missed their schedule. Wow, how often does that happen in construction these days??\nG W\na year ago\nWe ordered a bedroom set including a couple of custom pieces. We are so happy with our furniture. It is the Norwalk set from Veraluxe. The furniture is top quality. And Kloter Farms was so easy to work with. Delivery came when promised, and the whole process of ordering online was very smooth. They are so nice and friendly too. I recommend Kloter,and Veraluxe for all your furniture needs.\nChristopher Siart\na year ago\nI purchased a pool house and a pavilion thru Paul Roberts. The entire experience was fantastic. Paul's knowledge of their offerings is awesome. He was extremely helpful and patient with my decision making process. The installation was also very good; on time and top notch quality. I will definitely be purchasing more items from Kloter Farms in the near future.\nGraham Broberg\na year ago\nMy Garage exceeded my expectations and the price was very competitive! Jason personally assessed my site and helped me with the plans.\nTheresa D Graham\na year ago\nKeenan and Chris did an outstanding job with the delivery and set up of our recent purchase. They arrived on time, were friendly, highly professional, and explained the care for our upholstered items in detail. We will definitely visit Kloter Farms’ beautiful showroom again for future purchases!Thank you!T Graham\nNicholas Wahl. III\na year ago\nJust received our new dining room table. Our experience from the sales personnel to the two gentlemen who not only delivered the table but set it up and explained its care for future use was exemplary We are 100% pleased and look forward to using our new table for many years to come\nAndrew Gilman\na year ago\nKloter Farms was very thorough and professional in helping us design and the build our new garage. They did a site survey, provided detailed plans for permits, had an excellent sub-contractor to lay the foundation and had a skilled building team. Most important, we are very pleased with the finished garage. Andy Gilman\nAnne Riva\na year ago\nI just received my kitchen island and couldn't be happier. It's gorgeous! The delivery guys were great!\nSimi Capano\na year ago\nI took a drive to Kloter Farms last weekend...hour and a half from Stamford. Beautiful drive through rural Connecticut. I visited the two stores, this one, and the one with the kitchen islands and full kitchens. I ordered a kitchen island and chairs. Everything is customized. I am happy with the price and probably would have cost much more if I shopped in Lower Fairfield County or Westchester Country. Thank you Sierra for your patience and expertise. Delivery takes several months, so I'm glad I decided to order now. Can't wait to see the final product.\nKathy Tuozzo\na year ago\nGreat experience with Kloter Farms from purchase to delivery! The staff are knowledgeable about their products and friendly. Delivery was exceptional - they were on time, took every precaution, made sure I was happy and made sure I understood how to care for my new bedroom furniture. Will definitely purchase from Kloter Farms again!\nEric Elman\na year ago\n10/10. Yes, A+++. Steve and his team were exceptional to work with. Steve is down to earth, a straight shooter, right to the point, and his knowledge level is seemingly beyond his years. His crew was professional and courteous at every step of the way. Cabinets, well they are fully custom and when you compare woods used, thickness, joinery, hardware and finish they cannot be beat by anyone - and we did our due diligence. One of the major differences with Kloter kitchens is that the team that designs the kitchen, is the same team that installs the kitchen. Unlike other companies, they also provide a firm install date shortly after the contract is signed. Sure enough, the install took place on the day promised and they sized the install crew to get the job done in one day. Sure, a couple of small details needed tending to after the install, but they were back just as promised. Dan, their repair man was also prompt, courteous and very knowledgable taking care of the few details to our satisfaction. I am very particular and have high expectations - Kloter met, and exceeded them in some cases. Very highly recommended.\nPatricia Broskey\na year ago\nStephen helped make our dreams come true! From design to construction we could not have been happier. Stephen makes sure the function works and provides all the thoughtful ideas to add additional efficiency. We love the quality of the cabinets as much as the look. Kloter farms was exceptional to work with!! If you are looking for a new kitchen definitely go visit… you will not be disappointed!\nSusan Gerr\na year ago\nWe recently were in the market for a new sectional couch for our living room remodeling project. We have been customers of Kloter Farms for decades, and know they only sell quality pieces. We found the perfect couch with the right configuration to fit our room, and a great choice of fabric. The salesperson was extremely helpful and knowledgeble. The couch came a month ahead of estimated time and the delivery and setup crew was very prompt, courteous and thorough.\nVincent Vassallo\na year ago\nWent to Kloter Farms for a replacement shed. The whole company is top notch. Great salesperson, Kim. The site work man was great and did good work. She'd looks great, had a bubble in one of the siding pieces when shed arrived on Tuesday, contacted the company and siding was replaced Thursday the same week. Great customer service all around. Thanks for making our shed buying experience seamless. Vin and Kelly Vasssllo\nJanice Favreau\na year ago\nWe have been customers of Kloter Farms since the purchase of our home 8 years ago, and are extremely pleased with the quality of the product and the service received. From an outdoor shed to the new bed we just received - wonderful service from the store to delivery!\nChris L\na year ago\nKloter Farms just finished our new 32x26 Elite 2 story garage and we couldn't be happier with both the finished product and the whole experience working with the Kloter Team! This project was extensive and challenging, including demolition of an old garage and slab, navigating many planning and unique site challenges given the lot size, and ultimately the actual build process (which was amazingly quick, on-time as promised, and painless). From the start, Jason and his team worked with us extensively to help plan out the many custom features we wanted, like extra height walls and doors, maximum dormers on the 2nd floor for space (the 2nd floor is HUGE), custom stairway location, custom door spacing, matching our house siding, etc.). The build quality and quality of the materials is outstanding (and we are picky). Even the building inspector commented on the high quality. Many thanks to John (old garage demo, excavation, foundation, and very careful work in a tight space), Kevin, his Sons and Will for the incredibly quick and painless build experience, and Jason for his extensive experience and advice on how to smooth out the inevitable challenges, and patience with my many questions. It's so refreshing to work with a local family business that treats its customers and its people (many of whom I spoke with have worked there for 20+ years) so well. Much appreciated, and we'll be back (dining room set is next on the list...)\nEric Zimmerman\na year ago\nPaul was very helpful and the glider is awesome for my daughter and granddaughter!! Would highly recommend this product!\nLori Allison\na year ago\nWe purchased the King Size Split Integrity retractable mattress. What is great is that you can get soft, med., or firm on your side while your partner can choose whatever mattress on their side. If you get the split retractable bed, you need to watch Youtube to find an easy way to apply the twin sheets on cuz if you're short like me, you won't be able to reach the middle of the bed to slip on the corner fitted pocket. Takes a little bit more time to make the bed but I don't care. A really good investment for a really good sleep. Customer Service from Retail Store to delivery goes above and beyond to make you happy.\nOff Grid King\na year ago\nThank you so much to Fred and Carl for making our experience with Kloter Farms so enjoyable and easy in furnishing our new farm house. More pics to come with our new dining room and living room once complete!\nDeb Bacewicz\na year ago\nWe just had our new family room furniture delivered - a sectional, recliner and end table. The furniture is beautiful and high quality. The delivery guys were very careful, considerate and respectful. We are thrilled. Thank you all.\nBob DiCicco\na year ago\nWorking with Kloter farms was an exceptional experience fromstart to finish and the delivery people were outstanding.\nleah gerber\na year ago\nOur kitchen experience with Kloter Farms was perfect and seamless. From the design, the install, the finishing touches, and the photos we are more than pleased with the outcome. We were remodeling an older home and Kloter Farms was able to design everything we were looking for in a small layout! We can’t rave about their team enough! Thank you!\nMary Ann Hanley\na year ago\nWe just purchased two couches for our living room and had the most enjoyable experience. From the sales personnel-who are helpful but definitely not pushy-through the delivery. Steve called to let us know what time to expect our delivery and they were there just as he said. Orion and Chris carried in the furniture and explained how to care for them. And, most importantly, you really felt the pride that all of them had for the work that they perform and for the company that they work for-quite a rarity these days. Thank you to all.\nDenise Egan\na year ago\nWorking with Stephen and his team on my beautiful kitchen was a pleasure from start to finish. They go over and beyond to deliver everything promised and more. The quality of the cabinets is exceptional. Thank you!\nLaura Byers\na year ago\nI am extremely happy with our kitchen remodel and the quality of the kitchen cabinets. The staff were professional, courteous and easy to work with. I would definitely recommend Kloter Farms.\nLaura Palmer\na year ago\nWe could not be happier with our entire experience! Highly recommend.\nRobert Urban\na year ago\nMy garage looks great, matches house perfectly. Kloter team does a great job and are hard working. The delivery trailer is a riot. Got all the pieces in place with one man and a remote control. I would recommend Kloter.\nJohn Allen\na year ago\nWe just had a complete bedroom set delivered. The furniture is beautiful and high quality. The delivery guys were very careful, considerate and respectful. Perfect experience.\nNoreen Quinn\na year ago\nIt was a wonderful experience from start to finish. This kind of customer service is hard to find. I worked with the most helpful, patient sales person who had a really good eye. Couch and chair arrived sooner than anticipated. Quality is excellent, delivery was smooth. Kloter Farms is now my destination for home furnishings.\nCheryl James\na year ago\nI had several pieces of furniture ordered from Kloter Farms delivered today by Chris, and Keenan. Just a few words to mention how careful they were delivering my furniture, polite, helpful in placement of the pieces, and explained clearly how to care for my new pieces. Both men are an outstanding asset to your organization, and concluding the sale of the furniture on a very positive note. Thank you.\nKathryn Perleoni\na year ago\nEverything was great! From our initial sales rep to the delivery people, Kloter Farms has top-notch customer service! Their furniture is high quality and built to last! We're very happy with our leather living room set.\nGene Lacerte\na year ago\nOnce again Kloter Farms met their high standards. My new Elran Recliner was delivered on time and the delivery people were accomodating and pleasant to work with. I have been dealing with Kloter Farms for over 10 years and have never been disappointed with their service or quality of the furniture they sell. I highly recommend them to family and friends.\nKathi Young\na year ago\nWe received our couch last week. It is perfect! It is well made and extremely comfortable to sit on and looks wonderful in our room. The young men that delivered it were prompt, polite and very conscientious. I would not hesitate to buy any furniture from Kloter.\nCharlotte Cyr\na year ago\nToday we received our couch, love seat, swivel chair and ottoman from Kloter Farms. This is our first purchase from them and we are so pleased with the quality and look of it. We want to extend our gratitude to our salesperson, Clarissa. She was so knowledgeable about the product and fabric colors. Her decorating ‘eye’ was spot on. Also thanks to the two gentlemen who delivered it. They were so careful not to bang the furniture into anything in their way. Thank you all.\nNancy Zimmerman\na year ago\nWe needed a new sleeper sofa and Fred was great! Delivered early and very professional! Love Kloter Farms!👍\nLorna Joseph\na year ago\nDining room set is beautiful. Quality craftsmanship.

Bought a custom bedroom set 2 years ago and it is still perfect and I love it! Soft close drawers, gorgeous stain and matte finish soft as glass. Quality craftsmanship. I wish all my furniture was Kloter made.\nKathy Dewey\na year ago\nWe've always had the very best customer service when ordering furniture with Kloter Farms. The staff is always kind, welcoming, and professional, including the delivery men who call ahead of arrival which is so appreciated. Thank you especially to Carl in Sales, and Chris and Keenan who delivered our recliner!\nMark Christodlous\na year ago\nI received my 12x24 today and it was everything I Expected it to be, kim was a pleasure to work with and made it simple and easy to order, the 2 gentleman that came and delivered it were amazing and nailed it exactly where i wanted it to go with no issues at all. Im very pleased with you guys, thanks again for the great work.\nDiane Dexter\na year ago\nWe received another sofa accent table for the living room and two additional chairs for our dining room set. As with our earlier purchases from Kloter, the quality is excellent. The two gentleman that delivered our furniture were on time, courteous and very professional. We highly recommend to others that they choose Kloter Farms for their furniture needs.Diane DexterDanielson, CT\nAndi Carty\na year ago\nThe staff is helpful without being overpowering. They answered all questions and made it so easy to work with them. The young gentlemen who delivered our bedroom furniture were incredibly polite and efficient. We would recommend them to all.\nMichele Mcmanus\na year ago\nI have been purchasing furniture from them for over 25 years. They have the highest quality furniture. They have longevity in staffing and the staff are always pleasant and helpful. No pressure to buy and they are available to answer any questions and they stand behind their products. My furniture looks today as new as it did 25 years ago. As for the delivery of my furniture they are true to their word. They give you a call the day before with a 2 hour window and they are on time. I highly recommend them to everyone. That you Kolker Farms for your outstanding products and services.\nLee DesRoches\na year ago\nWe visited 3 custom cabinet makers in CT before settling on Kloter Farms. Our kitchen is pretty small and was not a very good use of space. Stephen was able to make subtle changes to our kitchen layout that made our small space more usable with a more spacious feeling. We are able to utilize more storage in our new kitchen and we don't constantly bump into each other when cooking and prepping our meals.Even if you are a handy person, I would recommend having Kloter Farms do the cabinet installation because they are not just professional as the label goes, they truly are top notch and get the job done quickly. Things like uneven floors and walls are taken into account so your cabinets look as if they were built with your house without unsightly gaps. They even take into account small details like floor tile grout channels, making it look like the cabinet is “melted” to the floor. Hard to beat that kind of quality work and the installation price is not that bad considering they come in with a crew on a mission to get your kitchen up and running as soon and efficiently as possible.All time frames were met as discussed months prior during the project planning phase, no disappointing delays or cancellations, thoroughly professional. Stephen is also good at giving design advice based on what look you are going for. Once you communicate what you want, he will make the best suggestions based on your needs. He is very responsive during the the entire process, from selection to planning, to post install, making you feel reassured whenever you have a question or need advice.The cabinets are high quality and seem very durable. We went with stained cabinets and the wood is smoother than I have seen on any cabinets. The protective finish is also a nice touch and all hardware like slides and internal organizers are of the highest quality, think trade sourced quality, not things you can find in your local home improvement store. We even had a cabinet tech as part of our installation who filled nail holes and matched the colors perfectly as well as “fine tune” all the doors and drawers so they work flawlessly.A truly great experience for our remodel and we are very happy with the layout changes, cabinets, and service we received from Kloter Farms!\nLynn Warriner\na year ago\nThe furniture is beautiful, and excellent quality! We have purchased many pieces of furniture for our home, and have been extremely satisfied!! The customer service in the store, and on the phone and the delivery employees are all excellent, polite, and very professional!!!\nElizabeth Murphy\na year ago\nIt was a pleasure shopping at Kloter Farms and we are very happy with the bedroom furniture set we purchased. Sean and another pleasant employee delivered it on time, were very careful of our walls when moving it in, and set it up in a timely, professional manner. We will definitely shop at Kloter Farms again.\nEdward Sederquest\na year ago\nExcellent products and service.\nRebecca Pond\na year ago\nGREAT EXPERIENCE!Becky my sales representative was amazing!The guys that delivered today were professional and nice.Could not be happier!Highly recommend!Thank youRebecca\ntracey bennett\na year ago\nWe couldn't be happier with our recent furniture purchase of a sofa , armchair , mission cabinet and dining room chairs , fabulous quality and the staff from the point of sales to delivery and placement were equally as fabulous\nTerry Brennan\na year ago\nI just received the leather recliner and chair I ordered. They are gorgeous. The help I received from the Kloter Farms team was amazing. Their delivery staff was also professional and careful when they were placing the chairs. They also took the time to put felt pads on the feet. I have also ordered a sectional and can't wait for that to arrive. This store and it's staff are wonderful.\nAndrew B Cavazza\na year ago\nMy wife and I purchase a Chatham Queen Turned Post Bed andConform firm Latex-Queen Bunkle Board Base and received it today it is extremely comfortable. Cathy the associate was a professional in all means. Steve in the shipping department was also a professional in scheduling the delivery. The two delivery personnel were very caring and very polite and very efficient in removing the old bed and setting up the new one. My wife and I will purchase more in the future.Thank you,Andrew & Barbara Cavazza\nrosemary dziubinski\na year ago\nNothing but good to say about my experience with Kloter Farms!They were helpful and very patient with me as I ever so slowly made my decisions…. I had to wait a bit for my order, but it came in before they said, in time for Christmas. The delivery team was prompt, pleasant and professional! I’m a happy girl! Thanks to all!\nJoseph Twarkins\na year ago\nWe recently purchased a sofa from Kloter Farms and are very satisfied with the quality of this American-made product.Our Salesman (Carl)was very professional and knowledgeable regarding product & options.When two young men delivered our sofa this week, they also were professional and on-time with delivery.They also advised us regarding fabric maintenance recomendations.We purchased a storage shed from Kloter Farms many years ago and that American-made product also was built to a high quality standard and was exceptional.\nJeffrey Tucker\na year ago\nSolid, well-made furniture at reasonable prices. No particle board, or case goods made from old orange crates! Wide selection of styles, woods (oak or cherry, plus some others), stains, and hardware. The guys who delivered my bed, dresser, and nightstand were great, and made sure everything was right before they left.\nJeffrey Crompton\na year ago\nJason and his team made the process easy, and were helpful getting the town in line with a structure this size. We went with kloter after a great experience with a shed at our last home, on a reference from my parents, who's shed is now 30 years old and going strong!\nEdgar Hettrich\na year ago\nIt was a pleasure working with Kloter Farms Jason on the new 2-Car Garage. Kloter Farms was very patient with me as I went through the red tape and challenges of demolishing a 16’x18’ garage that of course had lead in the wood. Although this led to a long delay I was finally able to proceed and Kloter worked with me on a schedule that got the structure completed before this winter. It is a beautiful 1-1/2 story 2 4’x28’ garage. We’ll enjoy this for years and it is sure to add value to our property.\nKate Dubuque\na year ago\nWe purchased our\"office in late 2019. We run a small dog rescue; Little Rhody Rescue and Quarantine Inc in Glocester RI.First, the team was professional, courteous and my finished product was EXACTLY what I ordered and wanted. The price was reasonable - especially for the quality that I received!We received a beautiful grant from the singer Miranda Lambert's Mutt Nation Foundation. We cleared trees, prepped for the bug day ! Delivery was flawless and SO fast!....Then the pandemic hit. Our 'office' allowed us to hold adoption events even when all of the stores were closed to adoption events.This beautiful 'Shed' has become a lifeline and helped us to save 1,200 dogs' and cats' lives- all because it enabled us to continue our work!!!Thanks I can recommend no one more!\nJishnu Gupta\na year ago\nFantastic furniture and an excellent delivery experience. They put everything together, arrived at exactly 1 minute ahead of the scheduled 2 hr window (10:44 instead of 10:45!) and worked quickly and diligently. The furniture is beautiful and exactly what we expected. It is heirloom quality.\nMichael Magner\na year ago\nMy shed was delivered yesterday and I can't tell you how happy I am with it! It has solved all of my outdoor storage needs and then some, and it is beautiful! A special shout-out to Tyler the delivery guy. I was thoroughly amazed at his expertise in getting into my difficult driveway (even the garbage man won't come down it) and the way he handled that trailer all by himself and landed the shed exactly where I wanted it. It's 10 X 20\" so no easy task. I highly recommend these guys! Thanks again Tyler!\nJohn Briare\na year ago\nAbsolutely Amazing Company and Staff. Bought a 12x14 Cape Shed. I was at the tail end of a major patio renovation and decided to demolish a mouse infested shed that I have had for 30 years. Problem was... I needed the shed delivered within 2 weeks before area would become non-accessible. I first went to a shed dealer down the road... was told it would be 8-12 weeks... nothing they could do. Thinking I was going to be building the new shed myself... I tried Kloter Farms. I told them my dilemma and they said no problem... they could get it done within 2 weeks. Walked the yard... found a beautiful shed... signed the paperwork and literally got a call within 36 hours and shed was delivered to my house within 72 hours of first stepping foot in their showroom. They bailed me out big time. As far as price... I understand building a shed would save money... but with screws running $40 for 5 lbs, and lumber prices insane... It cost me about $1500 over cost of materials, not including tax, to simply buy the shed from Kloter. I will never build my own shed again. Great Quality... ask for Joe Schneider (Sales Rep I dealt with)\nSherry Michaud\na year ago\nLinda Aschenbach\na year ago\nDelivery was a few minutes earlier. The 2 gentlemen placed my new bedroom set exactly where I requested. When I asked the the guys what they thought, the response was “awesome” and it is.

I have loved it over the years but this year it developed a few cracks on the table top and bench. I called Kloter Farms a month ago and here I am a month later with brand new tops for 2 of my items. They picked up the products and replaced the tops and delivered them to me today. I am so impressed with the customer service they provide. The adage, \" you get what you pay for\" certainly holds true. Thank you Kloter Farms\nAshor Yousif\na year ago\nWe bought a shed last year from Kolter Farms. We love it.

We chose Kloter Farms to replace our 45-year-old kitchen. We received excellent service at every step of the process, from designing the new layout, selecting the best style and finishes, and though the installation process. The quality of the cabinets was only matched by the skillful carpentry and attention to detail of Stephen and his installation team. Our kitchen ceiling, walls and floor are very crooked. Stephen expertly scribed and shimmed the cabinets and moldings to correct for our kitchen’s unevenness. We are extremely pleased with our new custom kitchen and have received many compliments from family and friends.

LEARN MORE ›\n\nWide Load Permits – There is a Wide Load Permit required by the Department of Transportation (DOT) that will appear as shipping when you check out. This applies to only buildings and gazebos that are 10′, 12′ and 14′ wide. This $25 (per state traveled through) tax has nothing to do with building permits and is secured by Kloter Farms.\n\nIf your site does not allow truck and trailer delivery please contact us for more information about kit assembly. LEARN MORE ›\n\nCustom Multi-Car Garages\n\nStandard delivery and set up of multi-car garages is included in the pricing for the first 50 miles, originating from Ellington, CT.\n\nOutdoor Furniture\n\nPick-up\nMany outdoor furniture items, including poly adirondack chairs, are in stock (year-round) in our warehouse and may be picked up in Ellington, CT.

To that end, each of our custom barns, sheds, garages, gazebos, pool houses, and other structures is designed with a combination of form and function in mind. Whether you’re looking for a prefab barn, barn shed, barn garage, or something else, we can help you bring your vision to life and exceed your expectations in the process.

Our helpful and friendly sales team is ready to help – regardless of whether you’re just starting to think about adding a barn or you’re midway through your customization project with us.\n\nThe Many Benefits of Adding a Barn to Your Property\n\nAdding a barn to your property is a big decision. However, it’s also one of the smartest decisions you can make if you’re looking to improve your home and how you live in it. One of the primary reasons people add barns is because of the sought-after storage space they provide. Available in a variety of sizes, these structures offer extra space for everything from seasonal items to pool and patio furniture and automobiles.\n\nHowever, a Kloter Farms barn is about much more than storage. It can also extend the livable square footage of your home. Always fantasized about a man cave, she-shed, home gym, playroom, workshop, or another bonus room? The sky’s the limit with Kloter Farms. There are near-endless ways to design and customize your barn to help you live better in your home. This is why we urge you to think of a new barn not as an expense but as an investment in your quality of life.\n\nCustom Barns and Storage Sheds for Sale in CT, RI, and MA\n\nAnother outstanding attribute of Kloter Farms barns is their customizability. We know that different homeowners have different needs. That’s why we leave the details up to you. Whether you’re looking for a barn garage that will harmoniously blend with your home and landscape, or you want features that maximize your barn’s functionality, we’re eager to bring your vision to life. This holds true for every one of our outdoor structures, including barn-style garages, storage sheds, and more.\n\nDon’t see what you’re looking for? We’ll work with you to make sure you get exactly what you want and need.\n\nFunctional Structures Built with Your Needs in Mind\n\nNot all storage buildings serve the same purpose. The Kloter Farms team will work closely with you to identify your specific needs and to determine how best to meet them. Details like 100 percent maintenance-free vinyl and Permatrim, pressure treated wood floors, reinforced doors, handmade shutters, arch-top end vents, and a variety of rooflines are just a few of the ways a Kloter Farms barn can be customized to your specifications.\n\nThere’s a reason why so many people return to Kloter Farms again and again for heirloom-quality furniture, storage buildings, and other custom structures.

These above-and-beyond services include free delivery on orders totaling more than $2,500 within Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island, site preparation to ensure proper leveling so that doors operate correctly and detailed drawings provided upon request for building permits.\n\nAnd because we believe so strongly in our products, the materials we use to make them, and the people who create them, we also offer a 10-year guarantee on every storage building. Our furniture and outdoor structures are designed to be true heirloom pieces for your home, and, with proper maintenance and care, they will continue to bring you years of joy and use.\n\nAt Kloter Farms, our motto is, “Quality is the foundation on which we build,” and we proudly stand by this in everything we do. We hope you will choose Kloter Farms to help you improve your living space and enhance your quality of life with a beautiful, functional custom barn or other structure.\n\nStart Your Custom Barn Journey with Kloter Farms\n\nSpecialty Building & Barns | Farmhouse Style Inspiration & Ideas\n\nQ&A\nWhat is the difference between a barn and a shed? \n\nTraditionally a barn referred to an agriculture structure, but the term has broadened to include structures that serve non-agricultural uses, such as storage sheds, and still pay homage to these “barns” by design. A shed traditionally serves as a storage unit. Kloter Farms offers both barns and sheds and can help you choose the outdoor structure that fits your needs.\n\nCan a barn be a car garage?\n\nA barn can be used as a car garage! Based upon the broader definition of a “barn”, a barn can be used for many reasons including a garage, studio, workshop, home office, etc. Back in the day, barns would have housed the main vehicle for transpiration which was then a carriage. Modern barns today serve the same function but now house our cars, trucks, and more!\n\n \nSign Up for Sales & Events\n\nSubscribe to our emails for the latest news and upcoming sales & events.\n\n860.871.1048\n\n216 West Road, PO Box 440\n\nEllington, CT 06029\n\n(Corner of Route 83 & 286)\n\nFacebook\n \nInstagram\n \nPinterest\n \nYouTube\nStore Hours\nMonday\n9am - 6pm\nTuesday\n9am - 7pm\nWednesday\n9am - 6pm\nThursday\n9am - 7pm\nFriday\n9am - 5pm\nSaturday\n8am - 5pm\nSunday\nClosed\nCustomer Service\nMy Account\nGift Cards\nFinancing\nDelivery & Pick-up\nView Catalog\nContact Us\nKloter Farms\nOur Story\nReviews\nCareers\nPhoto Gallery\nKloter Farms Blog\nDirections\nGoogle Rating\n4.8\nBased on 478 reviews\nGoogle Rating\n4.8\nBased on 478 reviews"

SHOP SALE\nHome\nPergolas & Pavilions\nPergolas\nWood & Vinyl Pergolas For Sale\n\nMany homeowners are looking to improve the look and livability of their outdoor spaces. There’s no better way to achieve both objectives than with the addition of a pergola to your deck, backyard, poolside, or another exterior area.\n\nWhether you’ve always dreamed of having a pergola or you’re just starting to consider enhancing your property with one, you’ll find everything you need to make the most informed buying decision below.\n\nShowing all 8 results\n\nArtisan Pergola (Cedar/Vinyl)\nArtisan Pergola (Vinyl)\nHearthside Pergola (Pressure Treated Pine)\nLouvered Pergola (Aluminum)\nSolace Build-Your-Own Daybed Pergola (Cedar)\nTraditional Pergola (Pressure Treated Pine)\nTraditional Pergola (Vinyl)\nUltimate Louvered Pergola (Vinyl)\nThe Benefits of Pergolas\n\nWhen it comes to offering a beautiful blend of form and function, you can’t go wrong with a pergola. Here’s a closer look at seven benefits of adding one to your property:\n\n1. Pergolas are elegant and beautiful.\n\nThink of any backyard you’ve ever seen with a pergola. Chances are, the stately structure created a visual focal point in the space while elevating its surroundings.\n\nUnlike many simpler outdoor structures, pergolas are sculptural and architectural in design. This means that they have the potential to transform even the most ordinary space into an extraordinary one.\n\n2. Pergolas are a beneficial addition to your landscape design.\n\nPergolas are beautiful design elements in and of themselves. However, they also serve several practical functions, including providing support for climbing plants and flowers. Home gardeners and professional landscape artists alike love pergolas for their ability to nurture clematis, wisteria, and grape vines. Perhaps the only thing as beautiful as a pergola is one adorned by meandering vines and vibrant flowers!\n\nThe best part? Using a pergola to enhance your landscaping involves very little work. Just plant in the right place, tie properly, and flowers and plants will ascend on their own.\n\n3. Pergolas can create and define spaces.\n\nWhether you’re looking for a covered gathering space or you simply want to make a large, empty backyard feel more intimate, pergolas are a perfect way to achieve your goals. But because of their airy and open design, they won’t make a small space feel smaller. It’s a win-win!\n\n4. Pergolas provide sun and shade.\n\nJust because pergolas have an airy, open design doesn’t mean they don’t provide shade. While there will always be places for the sun to enter, the beams can offer ample coverage while still allowing sky views.\n\nThat being said, if you’d like to introduce more shade with a pergola, you can add fabric to create an awning effect or install a lush climbing plant.\n\n5. Pergolas are an affordable outdoor structure solution.\n\nCompared to many outdoor structures, pergolas are relatively affordable and easy to build. Depending on your price point and goals, you can find a pergola that will have a significant impact on your yard – and not on your bank account.\n\nWith so many homeowners looking to expand the square footage of their homes, pergolas are an excellent way to accomplish this without dealing with an expensive, time-consuming, and disruptive addition.\n\n6. Pergolas enhance your home’s curb appeal.\n\nPergolas improve your home’s curb appeal and make a striking statement with guests. While you may have no short-term plans to put your home on the market, a pergola can make your home more attractive to potential buyers and enhance its desirability when the time comes. The more desirable your home is, the higher the price it will collect and the faster it will sell.\n\n7. Pergolas are durable with minimal maintenance.\n\nWe’ve already established that pergolas deliver some serious value. Even better, they do this with maximal staying power and minimal maintenance requirements.\n\nTake vinyl pergolas, for example. Not only does this hearty material look amazing, but it also doesn’t fade, peel, chip, rot, splinter, or discolor. Nor does it require routine staining and other preventive measures!\n\nThe Many Types of Pergolas\n\nPergolas are available in a versatile assortment of sizes, styles, materials, and finishes. Two of the most popular types are vinyl and wood pergolas, each of which offers its own set of benefits. If you’re looking for a modern pergola or a more classic aesthetic, you’ll find that, too.\n\nDon’t see the exact pergola you want? A custom pergola is a perfect solution. Just choose the material, style, colors, and features, and you can bring your vision to life while also creating a structure that will harmoniously integrate with its environment.\n\nKloter Farms Pergolas\n\nWhen it comes to pergolas for sale in CT, RI, and MA, Kloter Farms offers the highest-quality options available today.

If I could give 10 stars, I would! Every worker coming to our house was great and the finished barn is everything we thought it would be and more. We have a Kloter Farm shed we purchased 26 years ago that is still standing and in great shape so we know the larger structure will be just as solid. Thank you to everyone at Kloter Farms for making this the easiest and fastest build we have ever done. Here's a photo of the day the crane was onsite. The entire building shell went up in 1 day!\nJennifer Chenail\n2 months ago\nWe loved working with the team at Kloter Farms. They walked us through the entire process and helped us get everything in order for town permits, etc. From the site prep through the building process, the team was incredible and we couldn’t be happier with the final product. Thank you!\nNicole Morosanu\n7 months ago\nKloter farms is a well oiled machine. They are professional, punctual and efficient. The final product is worth the investment. That said, just a couple words of advice if you are inexperienced with these types of builds and the process (like me). First, unless you know who you’re dealing with on the concrete side stick with Kloter and their subcontractors, it will save you time and likely money in the longer run. Second, you do need to ask for a break down of what is to be expected with respect to permits, expectations and time line. That said Kloter’s representatives are responsive and will provide a breakdown of requirements and expectations upon request.\nJeffrey Gebrian\n8 months ago\nWe had heard that Kloter Farms had a good and reliable reputation when we were planning for a new, detached garage. We followed up and visited their premises Fall of 2022. Our experience began with a friendly and professional tour of the facilities by a sales person ending with a close look at a 20' by 20' garage which we knew would fit our tight site. Our questions and comments about budgets and schedule were clearly and professionally answered. From there we decided to go ahead and received the same high level of service from contract to schedule to construction; from the footing, foundation and floor to the building walls, doors and roof. Every single person who worked on every aspect of this garage knew what they were doing and did so in a very courteous, skilled and professional manner. We will highly recommend Kloter Farms. Robin and Jeffrey Gebrian.\nRoy Greenwood\n11 months ago\nOur new garage is everything we expected it to be, the process from start to finish was professional and courteous. Kloter Farms helped us with the plans and permitting process and the crews were excellent when it came time to build.\nERIC DELONG\na year ago\nI would like to thank all the crew at Kloter Farms. Our experience from start to finish has been exceptional. We are very pleased with the support, delivery, installation and especially the garage itself. Kloter Farms was able to customize our garage to our exact specifications. The end product looks and feels like it has always been a part of our 1940s Cape Cod homestead.\nMichael Keating\na year ago\nWell, it was a wonderful experience to work with Jason and his team to complete this final phase of a restoration project of an old Victorian home.From start to finish the team helped us in every way.Thank you Jason, John, Kevin (and sons)… can’t leave out delivery and garage door crew.I now have a gazebo, shed and garage. Thanks again. Mike\nLynn Clark\na year ago\nThis is the second time we have gone to Kloter for a structure on our property.The first was a large shed and that experience was very gratifying and we love our little barn. It's too beautiful to be called a shed. This time we went for a two car garage and the experience was amazing. First, Jason Kloter came to our home with a truckful of samples, pictures, ideas, etc. and sat with us for two hours helping us design the garage. It is now up and looks fabulous. The team that built the foundation and redesigned the driveway as well as the team that assembled the garage were excellent. We cannot thank you all enough.\nJohnny O\na year ago\nWe are extremely pleased with the garage Kloter Farms built for us and the service they provided from start to finish. Bottom line: If we had to do it all over, we would use Kloter Farms again without a second thought.I grew up in a family of skilled and perfectionist craftsmen. Matt and his build crew are cut from the same cloth. From the very beginning, Matt's client service and communication were top notch. We worked through all the planning together and his experience was invaluable in helping us develop a customized plan to suit our needs and budget. Matt remained hands-on during critical phases of construction, working alongside the build team to ensure perfect fit and finish. And the build team, led by J & R, were incredible too. I have not seen harder working or more skilled tradesmen. The product itself is of superior build. No skimping on construction methods and materials...actually better than stick-built in several ways. Finally, they never missed their schedule. Wow, how often does that happen in construction these days??\nGraham Broberg\na year ago\nMy Garage exceeded my expectations and the price was very competitive! Jason personally assessed my site and helped me with the plans.\nAndrew Gilman\na year ago\nKloter Farms was very thorough and professional in helping us design and the build our new garage. They did a site survey, provided detailed plans for permits, had an excellent sub-contractor to lay the foundation and had a skilled building team. Most important, we are very pleased with the finished garage. Andy Gilman\nChris L\na year ago\nKloter Farms just finished our new 32x26 Elite 2 story garage and we couldn't be happier with both the finished product and the whole experience working with the Kloter Team! This project was extensive and challenging, including demolition of an old garage and slab, navigating many planning and unique site challenges given the lot size, and ultimately the actual build process (which was amazingly quick, on-time as promised, and painless). From the start, Jason and his team worked with us extensively to help plan out the many custom features we wanted, like extra height walls and doors, maximum dormers on the 2nd floor for space (the 2nd floor is HUGE), custom stairway location, custom door spacing, matching our house siding, etc.). The build quality and quality of the materials is outstanding (and we are picky). Even the building inspector commented on the high quality. Many thanks to John (old garage demo, excavation, foundation, and very careful work in a tight space), Kevin, his Sons and Will for the incredibly quick and painless build experience, and Jason for his extensive experience and advice on how to smooth out the inevitable challenges, and patience with my many questions. It's so refreshing to work with a local family business that treats its customers and its people (many of whom I spoke with have worked there for 20+ years) so well. Much appreciated, and we'll be back (dining room set is next on the list...)\nRobert Urban\na year ago\nMy garage looks great, matches house perfectly. Kloter team does a great job and are hard working. The delivery trailer is a riot. Got all the pieces in place with one man and a remote control.

Kloter Farms was very patient with me as I went through the red tape and challenges of demolishing a 16’x18’ garage that of course had lead in the wood. Although this led to a long delay I was finally able to proceed and Kloter worked with me on a schedule that got the structure completed before this winter. It is a beautiful 1-1/2 story 2 4’x28’ garage. We’ll enjoy this for years and it is sure to add value to our property.\nEric Weiner\n2 years ago\nI wish I could give more than 5 stars because Kloter Farms earned them. Our garage & studio turned out great no doubt due to the fantastic staff that we encountered throughout the design and build process. The team was knowledgeable, knew how to listen to our needs, communicated promptly, and were excellent craftsmen. They met the schedules down to the day, and made the whole process easy and enjoyable.Highly recommended!\nBriana Smith\n2 years ago\nWe have had an amazing experience from start to finish with Kloter Farms. Picking out the garage we wanted was so much easier than we expected- with the help of the incredible staff. Making payments were easy and the installation was insanely fast but thorough. They even took a magnet around the foundation to pick up nails that were potentially lost and that was a detail my husband was over the moon about. The structure is beautiful and everyone has been a joy to work with. Couldn’t ask for better customer service or a better experience overall!\nJohn Mayer\n3 years ago\nWe purchased a 24 X 24 Statesman Garage from Kloter Farms. The foundation work and the building of the garage were excellent. Schedules were kept and the work was professional in every aspect. We are very happy with our garage.John Mayer Ashford\nBill Thompson\n3 years ago\nWe are so impressed with the two buildings that Kloter built for us – working with Jason Kloter was a pleasure, and he should receive a medal for patience and attention to details. The quality and precision of the materials and the structure far exceeded our expectations, and we are so glad we took the prefab route. In addition to Jason's incomparable assistance, the crew that did the assembly and provided the finishing touches were highly skilled and really pleasant to work with. An amazing experience all around!\nRalph Coppola\n3 years ago\nToday we took delivery of our beautiful single car garage! The process was incredible, from Lisa in the sale department to the wonderful people on the phone! Not to mention Dylan and his right hand man the delivery professionals! A delivery that looked nearly impossible to my husband and I Dylan made possible! These folks are awesome! Thank you Kloter Farms!!\nLinda Greenier\n3 years ago\nWe can’t say enough about customer service at Kloter Farms. From the moment we entered the showroom until we received delivery of our furniture the experience was flawless. This is our fourth purchase from Kloters. We purchased a shed, a one car garage, a dining table with 8 chairs, and just recently a new bedroom set. The workmanship and quality in the detailing is very evident on each piece. Our bedroom set was delivered yesterday by two very knowledgeable men. They took care in putting all pieces together and answering any questions we had.

Retreat with that book you’ve been meaning to read. Perhaps you’d like to just sit and enjoy the birds singing and hearing the children play. The way we see it, a Kloter Farms Sunroom or Conservatory is a special place where you can just get away from it all. (Like a short vacation without any packing!) It can all be just a short walk from your back door. Put one at the edge of the woods; under the big tree in the backyard or on the hill with the view – anywhere on your property where you’ve always wanted to spend more time if only you could.

One excellent solution? Living better and more fully outside of our homes. While interior square footage is limited, there are many ways to expand the liveability of your residence by taking advantage of exterior space. Enter sunrooms. Here’s a closer look at the many benefits of adding a sunroom, conservatory, or another outdoor structure to your property.\n\n1. They create versatile extra space.\n\nOne of the most amazing things about sunrooms is their ability to create additional indoor space for homeowners. Whether you’re looking to extend your family or living room, make room for entertaining, or create a relaxing sanctuary, sunrooms can do all of these things and more. They’re also appropriate for man caves, she-sheds, and home gyms. Love plants? While a sunroom isn’t a greenhouse, it’s the next best thing. Sunrooms can even be unique and beautiful dining spaces!\n\nThe takeaway? Whatever kind of extra space you need, a sunroom can help you fulfill your goals. There are no rules regarding how to utilize the extra space offered by a sunroom. That’s part of the beauty of them! When it comes to personalizing your home to meet your unique wants and needs, a sunroom may be the answer you’re looking for.\n\n2. They increase your home’s value.\n\nAccording to data from Remodeling Magazine, sunrooms can increase the value of a home by upwards of $33,000! So while you may not be thinking of selling now, a sunroom can put you in a better position if and when you decide to put your home on the market.\n\nWhile return on investment (ROI) is a worthwhile consideration, it’s far from the only way a sunroom delivers value. Because of the natural light they let in, sunrooms have the potential to reduce your energy bills. There’s also the fact that sunrooms improve your quality of life, and you can’t put a price tag on that.\n\n3. They let you enjoy your natural surroundings.\n\nNatural lighting, greenery, and fresh air are all celebrated for their physical and mental health benefits. A sunroom’s abundant windows and doors offer access to all of these advantages while simultaneously shielding you from less desirable elements of the great outdoors, including mosquitos and other pests, wind, sun, and rain. In short, sunrooms offer all the advantages of nature with none of the downsides.\n\nSunrooms can also help you enjoy the beauty of your particular property. Is there a scenic view that you love in or around your backyard? You can position your sunroom to take it in.\n\n4. They add beauty to your property.\n\nSunrooms are elements of beauty in and of themselves. These graceful and airy structures seamlessly integrate with their surroundings while adding visual interest to your environment.\n\nCustomize Your Kloter Farms Sunroom\n\nWant to maximize the value of your sunroom even more? Personalize it to your particular wants, needs, and objectives for living. In addition to being available in a variety of styles, sizes, and materials, sunrooms can also be further customized across aspects like roof style, siding color, and roof color. You can even opt to have your structure delivered pre-wired for the ultimate convenience and functionality.\n\nThe Kloter Farms Difference\n\nAnother standout quality of a Kloter Farms sunroom is our paramount commitment to customer service. When you buy a sunroom from Kloter Farms, you get much more than an attractive outdoor structure. You also get the partnership of our caring and experienced team through every element of its conceptualization, building, delivery, and installation in CT, RI, and MA.\n\nHave a question at any point during the process? We’re available to address your concerns to ensure your optimal satisfaction – and peace of mind. Have sunroom ideas and want some feedback on how best to bring them to life? We’re eager to help there, too.\n\nNot sure exactly what you’re looking for in a sunroom? View our online catalog for sunroom addition ideas, or visit our 16-acre display park to experience our four-season sunrooms and more for yourself.\n\nWhether you already know exactly what you want in a sunroom, or you’re just starting to think about adding a four-season room, patio enclosure, or other outdoor structure to your property, Kloter Farms can help.

Incorporating more counter chairs and stools into your kitchen design can help ensure that there will be room at the table (or island!) for everyone.\n\nVersatility\n\nKitchen stools and counter chairs are inherently versatile. Not only do they provide a place for people to sit during meals, but they also have the potential to expand how you use your counter. In addition to cooking and eating, you can use kitchen counters for everything from bill paying to homework help.\n\nNeed seating in another area of your home? Counter chairs and stools can also be easily relocated to create extra seating wherever and whenever you need it.\n\nAesthetic Appeal\n\nStools and counter chairs are available in a variety of designs. From classic Shaker styles to industrial-chic backless bar stools, incorporating seating is an opportunity to enhance and complement your home’s ambiance. Whatever your personal style, there’s a counter chair or stool that will blend harmoniously with it.\n\nWhat to Look for in New Counter Chairs and Kitchen Stools\n\nNot all furniture is created equal, and this includes counter chairs and stools. Here are a few things to keep in mind to help you make the most of your investment:\n\nComfort\n\nWhile there’s no better feeling than sharing conversation and a cup of coffee with a friend at your kitchen counter, there’s no worse feeling than doing so on an uncomfortable chair or stool. As with all furniture for modern living, comfort is a top priority when selecting kitchen seating.\n\nCraftsmanship\n\nThe pride, attention, and dedication that goes into making handcrafted furniture simply cannot be replicated by pieces that are mass-produced. The knowledge, commitment, and skill of furniture artisans are exceptional, and it shines through in the furniture they make.\n\nDurability\n\nKitchen chairs and stools have to hold up to a lot of wear and tear. Well-made furniture is not only designed to serve you at the moment but to continue to deliver value for years to come.\n\nDesign\n\nWhy settle for ordinary seating when you can seek pieces that speak to your unique style and sensibility? Good design has the potential to enhance your environment and improve your quality of life.\n\nThe Benefits of Custom Counter Chairs and Stools\n\nCustom furniture lets you create the exact piece of furniture you envision in your living space. From the look and feel to features and functionality, limitless factors go into designing and manufacturing a piece of furniture. Personalizing your custom kitchen stools and chairs puts all of these things within your control. The result? Truly unique pieces of furniture that also serve as acts of self-expression.\n\nShop for Custom Seating at Kloter Farms\n\nOne way to derive all the benefits of handmade kitchen chairs? Partner with Kloter Farms. We offer an extensive selection of American-made stools, chairs, and more – all of which can be customized to your precise specifications.\n\nWhen we say our furniture is fully customizable, we mean it.

For a number of casual events and a lot of standing around we might suggest bar stools. But if you plan to gather and sit for a while something with back support, like hightop chairs may be more ideal.\n\nWhat is a good height for a kitchen island chair?\n\nA good height for a kitchen island chair will range roughly 36″ to 42″ high. We suggest measuring your kitchen island and consulting with Kloter Farms for the best recommended match.\n\nIs a kitchen island better than a kitchen table?\n\nKitchen islands may prove better than a kitchen table in certain situations. They provide a great use of space and offer more storage than your typical dining table.\n\nKitchen & Dining\nTables & Chairs\nCustom Tables\nArm & Side Chairs\nBenches\nCounter Chairs & Stools\nDining Collections\nAcadia Collection\nAsher Collection\nAshlyn Collection\nBellport Collection\nBerkeley Collection\nBranson Benson Collection\nBranson Braxton Collection\nBranson Brighton Collection\nBranson Brogan Collection\nBranson Callahan Collection\nBranson Dunmore Collection\nBranson Edison Collection\nBranson Farmhouse Collection\nBranson Hadley Collection\nBranson Hayward Collection\nBranson Kingsbury Collection\nBranson Kinsley Collection\nBranson Stonehill Collection\nBranson Wrought Iron Collection\nBurnet Collection\nCentury Collection\nCharlotte Collection\nConcord Collection\nDalton Collection\nEllwood Collection\nFairbanks Collection\nHaley Collection\nMilan Collection\nMission Collection\nRedmond Collection\nRidgefield Collection\nRocklin Mills Collection\nRowan Collection\nRyker Double Pedestal Collection\nRyker Single Pedestal Collection\nSag Harbor Collection\nSconset Collection\nSouthport Leg Collection\nSouthport Single Pedestal Collection\nStonewall Collection\nVandalia Collection\nVenice Collection\nVineyard Haven Collection\nWhiskey Barrel Pub\nBradford Series\nBradford Tables\nBradford Chairs\nBradford Benches\nBradford Counter Chairs & Stools\nBradford Dining Collections\nAsher Collection\nAshlyn Collection\nBellport Collection\nBerkeley Collection\nCharlotte Collection\nRidgefield Collection\nBranson Series\nBranson Tables\nBranson Chairs\nBranson Benches\nBranson Counter Chairs & Stools\nBranson Dining Collections\nBranson Benson Collection\nBranson Braxton Collection\nBranson Brighton Collection\nBranson Brogan Collection\nBranson Callahan Collection\nBranson Dunmore Collection\nBranson Edison Collection\nBranson Farmhouse Collection\nBranson Hadley Collection\nBranson Hayward Collection\nBranson Kingsbury Collection\nBranson Kinsley Collection\nBranson Stonehill Collection\nBranson Wrought Iron Collection\nCandor Designs Series\nCandor Designs Tables\nCandor Designs Chairs\nCandor Designs Benches\nCandor Designs Counter Chairs & Stools\nCandor Designs Dining Collections\nMission Collection\nRedmond Collection\nRowan Collection\nRyker Double Pedestal Collection\nRyker Single Pedestal Collection\nSouthport Leg Collection\nSouthport Single Pedestal Collection\nStonewall Collection\nVandalia Collection\nVineyard Haven Collection\nEastford Plains Series\nEastford Plains Tables\nEastford Plains Chairs\nEastford Plains Benches\nEastford Plains Counter Chairs & Stools\nEastford Plains Dining Collections\nAcadia Collection\nBurnet Collection\nConcord Collection\nEllwood Collection\nFairbanks Collection\nHaley Collection\nMilan Collection\nRocklin Mills Collections\nSag Harbor Collection\nSconset Collection\nBarstools & Counter Chairs\nKitchen Islands\n30\" - 35\" Long Islands\n45\" - 60\" Long Islands\n60\"+ Long Islands\nBest Sellers\nDesigner Series Islands\nIslands with Closed Bases\nIslands with Legs/Feet\nShop All Kitchen Islands\nBrowse Kitchen Islands\nCustom Kitchen Cabinets\nSideboards & Bar Cabinets\nHutches\n2-Door Hutches\n3-Door Hutches\n4-Door Hutches\nCorner Hutches\nVanity & Laundry Custom Cabinets\nBuilt-In Vanity Cabinets\nStand Alone Vanities\nCabin Hill Vanities\nCamden Vanities\nCharleston Vanities\nChloe Vanities\nTopeka Vanities\nStorage Cabinets & Curios\nPlease Visit Our Store, Call or Email\n\nWe're here to help!\n\nGET DIRECTIONS CALL 860-375-1008 EMAIL US\nKloter Farms Blog\nFarmhouse Kitchen Island Ideas (With Stools & Seating)\n\nThere is nothing as relaxing a cute little breakfast nook – a farmhouse kitchen island with seating.

SHOP SALE\nHome\nKitchen & Dining\nHutches\nWood Kitchen Hutches For Sale\n\nStorage is a commodity for many homeowners, and one of the most beautiful forms of storage that can be used in nearly any room of your home is a kitchen hutch. Whether you’re looking for an efficient yet attractive way to display, organize, and store kitchenware or you’re searching for creative storage for precious keepsakes, kitchen hutches offer a smart solution.\n\nShowing 1–16 of 67 results\n\nAddison Server\nAlden Sideboard\nAlden Wine Server\nBallard Sideboard\nBaltic Mission 6140 Cabinet with Doors\nBaltic Shaker 6110 Cabinet with Wine Racks\nBaltic Shaker Small Wine Cabinet\nBiltmore Sideboard\nButler’s Buffet with Wine Rack\nCharlotte Server\nDunmore Server\nEdmonton Server\nEmory Sideboard\nFairmont Coffee Bar\nFarmhouse Server\nHaley Server\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\nNext\nHutches for Kitchenware and Fine China\n\nThe most obvious use for hutches is storing items you’d usually find in a kitchen or dining room. Think back to your childhood and your grandparents’ home. More likely than not, a focal point in the kitchen or dining room was a hutch showcasing a collection of treasures and cherished items. More practical products were likely tucked away in the cabinets beneath the display area.\n\nIn this sense, a dining room or kitchen hutch is an ideal piece of furniture when it comes to supporting both the form and function of your home. While they’re inherently practical, hutches are also an opportunity to express your personal taste in terms of the items they display, as well as in your choice of hutch itself.\n\nBeyond the Kitchen and Dining Room\n\nWhile the main use that comes to mind for a hutch may be for displaying and storing kitchenware and fine china, there are many ways to utilize hutches in other areas of your home. For example, a hutch in the living room can be used as a bookcase or other display piece, while a hutch in the bedroom can be used for linen storage. While hutches work with all styles and decorating tastes, they especially align with the classic New England or farmhouse aesthetic.\n\nNot only do hutches look exquisite, but they also help people contain clutter, improve organization, and show off the things they love most in life. We can think of no better furniture investment than one that achieves these three things. Even if you’re short on space, corner hutches offer all of the advantages of a traditional hutch with a smaller footprint.\n\nMultifunctional Furniture at its Best\n\nWhen we say you can get creative about what to store in your hutch, we mean it! One of our favorite uses for hutches is to store and serve coffee and tea. But it doesn’t end there – hutches can also be used as bars, linen closets, crafting stations, and even storage for tools. Because of their dual storage and display functionality, hutches fall into the category of “multipurpose” furniture, making them especially useful to today’s homeowners who prioritize livability above all else.\n\nThere’s also the fact that a high-quality, handcrafted hutch is a gorgeous addition to your home in and of itself. Available in many styles and layouts, you’re sure to find the perfect wooden hutch, vintage kitchen hutch, or another hutch among our extensive inventory of hutches for sale.\n\nEven if you can’t find the perfect piece, you’re in luck with Kloter Farms. Our 100 percent Amish-made furniture can be customized with your choice of finishing options, such as stains, paint, distressing, and glazes. Features like touch lighting, self-closing drawer slides, and solid wood sides are just a few of the exquisite details you’ll find when you partner with Kloter Farms for a new kitchen hutch or another piece of fine furniture.\n\nAt Kloter Farms, we’re ready to help you find a wood hutch that meets your personal style and storage needs. Nearly all of our hutches have different sizes and layouts to choose from, so be sure to explore the various options to understand what’s available.\n\nWe invite you to visit our Ellington, CT showroom to experience our kitchen hutches and other custom handcrafted furniture for yourself!\n\nKitchen & Dining\nTables & Chairs\nBarstools & Counter Chairs\nKitchen Islands\nCustom Kitchen Cabinets\nSideboards & Bar Cabinets\nHutches\n2-Door Hutches\n3-Door Hutches\n4-Door Hutches\nCorner Hutches\nVanity & Laundry Custom Cabinets\nStorage Cabinets & Curios\nPlease Visit Our Store, Call or Email\n\nWe're here to help!\n\nGET DIRECTIONS CALL 860-375-1008 EMAIL US\n \nSign Up for Sales & Events\n\nSubscribe to our emails for the latest news and upcoming sales & events.\n\n860.871.1048\n\n216 West Road, PO Box 440\n\nEllington, CT 06029\n\n(Corner of Route 83 & 286)\n\nFacebook\n \nInstagram\n \nPinterest\n \nYouTube\nStore Hours\nMonday\n9am - 6pm\nTuesday\n9am - 7pm\nWednesday\n9am - 6pm\nThursday\n9am - 7pm\nFriday\n9am - 5pm\nSaturday\n8am - 5pm\nSunday\nClosed\nCustomer Service\nMy Account\nGift Cards\nFinancing\nDelivery & Pick-up\nView Catalog\nContact Us\nKloter Farms\nOur Story\nReviews\nCareers\nPhoto Gallery\nKloter Farms Blog\nDirections\nGoogle Rating\n4.8\nBased on 478 reviews\nGoogle Rating\n4.8\nBased on 478 reviews"

Thank you to Jim and Bill for excellent delivery and wizards in dropping shed in perfect spot\nStacy Sisk\n22 days ago\nGreat experience with Kloter Farms with our kitchen design. Lydia was great with the design and communication. Highly recommend Kloter for kitchen cabinets.\nLori Nolin\n25 days ago\n\"Even though I had a pretty good idea what I wanted my new kitchen to look like, Stephen did an excellent job guiding me through the entire process and bringing my vision to fruition. Throughout the entire project, Stephen provided helpful suggestions, the team kept me well-informed of the projectprogress and the completion timeline provided was precise. The quality and craftsmanship of the cabinets are comparable to fine custom furniture, they are absolutely stunning. I couldn't be more pleased with my Kloter Farms cabinets!\"\nKyle Wright\n25 days ago\nOur kitchen cabinets came out absolutely beautiful. Extremely high quality, attention to detail, and perfect installation\nGary Bohara\n3 months ago\nChristian and Bill were excellent, they did a great job figuring out how to get the shed on my pad.Can’t say enough about the two of them, also Kloter Farms is excellent to work with.Thank you for the great service\nNina Crapser\n8 months ago\nWe just had a 30 year old gazebo that was purchased originally from Kloter moved from my in-laws to our home & EVERYONE we worked with was awesome! Lisa & Nick in the office helped us navigate the move process & Dan & Bill took this family “heirloom” from Springfield to Stafford flawlessly. The customer service is excellent & so is the craftsmanship on this gazebo. After 30 years it’s still in wonderful shape.\nScott Cleary\n9 months ago\nMy wife and I ordered a 12 x 24 garage with special details. We are so happy!!!! Jim and Bill did a great job installing it and John was a master on the site work - like a surgeon with his machine, so precise and clean. All were exactly on schedule, as promised, and the final product is exactly as we desired. Thank you so much Kloter team! We'll spread the Kloter Farms word to all we know.\nBill Henson\n10 months ago\nIncredible experience. Everyone we met was so nice. The site prep was very professional and the delivery/installation was equally amazing. A well oiled machine at all levels. Great business.\nRoseann Belanger\na year ago\nFrom start to finish everything went according to plan. Stephen and his crew are very knowledgeable and were easy to work with. The finished product came out beautiful.\nSimi Capano\na year ago\nI took a drive to Kloter Farms last weekend...hour and a half from Stamford. Beautiful drive through rural Connecticut. I visited the two stores, this one, and the one with the kitchen islands and full kitchens. I ordered a kitchen island and chairs. Everything is customized. I am happy with the price and probably would have cost much more if I shopped in Lower Fairfield County or Westchester Country. Thank you Sierra for your patience and expertise. Delivery takes several months, so I'm glad I decided to order now. Can't wait to see the final product.\nEric Elman\na year ago\n10/10. Yes, A+++. Steve and his team were exceptional to work with. Steve is down to earth, a straight shooter, right to the point, and his knowledge level is seemingly beyond his years. His crew was professional and courteous at every step of the way. Cabinets, well they are fully custom and when you compare woods used, thickness, joinery, hardware and finish they cannot be beat by anyone - and we did our due diligence. One of the major differences with Kloter kitchens is that the team that designs the kitchen, is the same team that installs the kitchen. Unlike other companies, they also provide a firm install date shortly after the contract is signed. Sure enough, the install took place on the day promised and they sized the install crew to get the job done in one day. Sure, a couple of small details needed tending to after the install, but they were back just as promised. Dan, their repair man was also prompt, courteous and very knowledgable taking care of the few details to our satisfaction. I am very particular and have high expectations - Kloter met, and exceeded them in some cases. Very highly recommended.\nPatricia Broskey\na year ago\nStephen helped make our dreams come true! From design to construction we could not have been happier. Stephen makes sure the function works and provides all the thoughtful ideas to add additional efficiency. We love the quality of the cabinets as much as the look. Kloter farms was exceptional to work with!! If you are looking for a new kitchen definitely go visit… you will not be disappointed!\nleah gerber\na year ago\nOur kitchen experience with Kloter Farms was perfect and seamless. From the design, the install, the finishing touches, and the photos we are more than pleased with the outcome. We were remodeling an older home and Kloter Farms was able to design everything we were looking for in a small layout! We can’t rave about their team enough! Thank you!\nDenise Egan\na year ago\nWorking with Stephen and his team on my beautiful kitchen was a pleasure from start to finish. They go over and beyond to deliver everything promised and more. The quality of the cabinets is exceptional. Thank you!\nLaura Byers\na year ago\nI am extremely happy with our kitchen remodel and the quality of the kitchen cabinets. The staff were professional, courteous and easy to work with. I would definitely recommend Kloter Farms.\nLee DesRoches\na year ago\nWe visited 3 custom cabinet makers in CT before settling on Kloter Farms. Our kitchen is pretty small and was not a very good use of space. Stephen was able to make subtle changes to our kitchen layout that made our small space more usable with a more spacious feeling. We are able to utilize more storage in our new kitchen and we don't constantly bump into each other when cooking and prepping our meals.Even if you are a handy person, I would recommend having Kloter Farms do the cabinet installation because they are not just professional as the label goes, they truly are top notch and get the job done quickly. Things like uneven floors and walls are taken into account so your cabinets look as if they were built with your house without unsightly gaps. They even take into account small details like floor tile grout channels, making it look like the cabinet is “melted” to the floor. Hard to beat that kind of quality work and the installation price is not that bad considering they come in with a crew on a mission to get your kitchen up and running as soon and efficiently as possible.All time frames were met as discussed months prior during the project planning phase, no disappointing delays or cancellations, thoroughly professional. Stephen is also good at giving design advice based on what look you are going for. Once you communicate what you want, he will make the best suggestions based on your needs. He is very responsive during the the entire process, from selection to planning, to post install, making you feel reassured whenever you have a question or need advice.The cabinets are high quality and seem very durable. We went with stained cabinets and the wood is smoother than I have seen on any cabinets. The protective finish is also a nice touch and all hardware like slides and internal organizers are of the highest quality, think trade sourced quality, not things you can find in your local home improvement store. We even had a cabinet tech as part of our installation who filled nail holes and matched the colors perfectly as well as “fine tune” all the doors and drawers so they work flawlessly.A truly great experience for our remodel and we are very happy with the layout changes, cabinets, and service we received from Kloter Farms!\nBill\n2 years ago\nKloter Farms is the place to go if you are looking for the highest quality kitchen cabinets and expert carpenters to install them! We chose Kloter Farms to replace our 45-year-old kitchen. We received excellent service at every step of the process, from designing the new layout, selecting the best style and finishes, and though the installation process. The quality of the cabinets was only matched by the skillful carpentry and attention to detail of Stephen and his installation team. Our kitchen ceiling, walls and floor are very crooked. Stephen expertly scribed and shimmed the cabinets and moldings to correct for our kitchen’s unevenness. We are extremely pleased with our new custom kitchen and have received many compliments from family and friends. Thank you very much Kloter Farms!!!\nKitchen Cabinetry FAQs\nHow do I choose the right wood for my kitchen cabinets?\n\nAt Kloter Farms, we offer several wood varieties for our handcrafted kitchen cabinets, including oak, maple, cherry,  hickory, and more.

Custom kitchen cabinetry has the potential to transform both the look and feel of your home. Whether you’re building a new property or renovating an existing one, custom kitchens have extraordinary benefits – especially when you partner with Kloter Farms.\n\n \n\nThe Benefits of Custom Kitchen Cabinets\n\nCustom kitchen cabinets offer a multitude of benefits, including the following:\n\nMeeting Your Precise Wants and Needs\n\nThe best kitchen cabinets aren’t “one size fits all” for the simple reason that no two homeowners are alike. Kitchens are uniquely personal spaces. Want to make the most of yours? Custom kitchen design cabinetry will bring your exact vision to life.\n\nImproved Efficiency and Productivity\n\nWhether you’re an accomplished home chef or your microwave is your best friend, custom kitchen cabinets can help you maximize the time you spend prepping, cooking, and cleaning up. From optimizing your kitchen layout to incorporating time-saving features, there are many changes you can make that will streamline and improve how you use your kitchen.\n\nFulfilling Your Aesthetic Vision\n\nJust because functionality is important in a kitchen design doesn’t mean you have to sacrifice form. When you upgrade to a farm kitchen cabinet or another style from Kloter Farms, you add an element of timeless elegance to your environment. However, our handcrafted kitchen cabinets aren’t just beautiful; they’re also a testament to time-honored design and craftsmanship.\n\nMaximizing Your Space\n\nSpace is one of a homeowner’s most precious commodities. In addition to helping you create flow, custom kitchens also add space. For example, incorporating a kitchen island with cabinets creates storage and another counter for prep and cooking. Add stools, and you’ve got the perfect breakfast nook or homework perch.\n\n \n\nThe Best Custom Kitchens from Kloter Farms\n\nAt Kloter Farms, we know you have many options when it comes to custom kitchen cabinets. We take great pride in creating products that set the standard for everything from style to durability.\n\nNear-Endless Features and Functionality\n\nWhen it comes to customizing your kitchen cabinets with Kloter Farms, the sky is truly the limit. Pull-out drawers, deep drawers, trash and recycling pull-outs, pull-outs for herbs and spices, built-in utensil caddies, pull-outs for linen storage, “catch-all” cabinets, stand mixer lifts, pet bowl storage, and storage for baking sheets, cutting boards, and platters are just a sampling of the features you can incorporate into your cabinetry.\n\nYour Style and Sensibility\n\nWhile your entire home is an expression of you, kitchens are especially personal spaces. Not to mention that you spend a lot of time in yours – so shouldn’t it be the warm and welcoming environment of your dreams? From sleek and modern to classic and traditional, our custom designs let you create a kitchen that perfectly encapsulates your personal taste.\n\nEnduring Craftsmanship and Quality\n\nMass-produced furniture may seem like an easy solution, but easy is rarely best. That’s where we come in. Our custom kitchen cabinets and other solid wood furniture are crafted by skilled artisans in workshops across the US and Canada. They bring their vision, talent, and commitment to everything they do – and it shows in every truly remarkable final product.\n\nSturdy kitchen cabinet sides and partitions, soft-closing slides and hinges, and other innovative design elements add up to true heirloom pieces for your home.\n\nExtraordinary Customer Service\n\nAt Kloter Farms, we don’t just sell fine furniture. We’re also your partners in creating custom pieces that truly speak to how you live and what you love.

A sectional is a perfect solution for any design challenge you’re facing.\n\nSectionals have a variety of other valuable benefits, as well. Because of their adaptability, they can be used to create defined spaces in homes with open floor plans. For example, an L-shaped sectional can be a beautiful focal point in a living room while simultaneously separating it from the dining room or other area. Sectionals also amplify your seating options, which makes them great for families and frequent entertainers.\n\nStyles for Any Taste\n\nVersatility is one of the most compelling characteristics of sectionals. At Kloter Farms, we take this one step further thanks to an extensive selection of sectionals offered in hundreds of design styles, fabrics, and top-grain leathers. From classic and traditional to modern, minimalist, and everything in between, you’ll find exactly what you’re looking for at Kloter Farms. In addition to your choice of arm, leg, and back styles, we also offer other customizable features, such as nailhead, wood, and contrasting trim options. In short: No matter what your vision for your new sectional may be, we can help you bring it to life.\n\nFind Your Dream Sectional at Kloter Farms\n\nWith so many options to choose from, buying furniture can often seem overwhelming. At Kloter Farms, we don’t just sell beautiful, hand-crafted furniture; we also offer expert support throughout your entire shopping experience. Our friendly and knowledgeable team is ready to help you with any questions you may have about style, color, or design. In addition to encouraging you to view and touch our products for yourself, we’ll even send you home with swatches, so you can take your time while making your decision.\n\nWe invite you to visit our Ellington, Connecticut showroom today to see for yourself our extraordinary collection of sectionals and other family room furniture and living room furniture.\n\nLiving Room Furniture\nSofas Sectionals Chairs\nSofas\nSectionals\nChairs\nOttomans\nShop Styles\nSmith Brothers Collection\nElran Collection\nCraftsman Collection\nAccent Tables\nEntertainment Centers\nRockers & Gliders\nCurios\nPlease Visit Our Store, Call or Email\n\nWe're here to help!\n\nGET DIRECTIONS CALL 860-375-1008 EMAIL US\nKloter Farms Blog\nWhat Is An Ottoman?

Not only do wall beds appear and disappear with ease, but murphy beds also combine two of any homeowner’s most precious commodities: space and storage.\n\nIf you’re looking for a bed for a small bedroom, guest room, multipurpose room, office, studio apartment, or other space, Kloter Farms’ wooden Murphy beds are a clever and convenient solution.\n\nWhen you choose a Murphy bed from Kloter Farms, you can do so with the confidence and peace of mind that comes with knowing you are choosing a truly extraordinary, high-performance piece of furniture that will enhance your home and your life for years to come.\n\nTo learn more about our custom-built Murphy beds in CT, RI, and MA or to start designing your own custom wall bed, contact us today.\n\nShowing all 9 results\n\nCube Wall Bed\nDesk Wall Bed\nStandard Wall Bed\n2-Drawer Armoire Side Unit\nBookcase Side Unit with Bottom Door\nLarge Desk Side Unit\nSmall 2-Drawer Armoire Side Unit\nSmall Bookcase Side Unit with Doors\nSmall Single Armoire Side Unit\nMurphy Bed & Wall Bed Benefits\n\nMurphy beds have been around for more than a century, but wall beds are still the perfect example of design innovation. Rather than taking up space in your home 24/7, a Murphy bed only occupies space exactly when you need it to: at bedtime.\n\nReadying a room for yourself or overnight guests? Just pull the Murphy bed out of the wall at night. Need more space in your home the next morning? The same wall bed folds right into the wall leaving behind an ample amount of space for other activities of daily living.\n\nWall Beds: A Creative Space + Storage Solution\n\nIn a world where “more space” is a frequent desire among homeowners, Murphy beds provide exactly that. Even better? They do it by taking advantage of vertical wall space, which often goes underutilized.\n\nBut Murphy beds don’t just stop at freeing up the space a bed usually occupies. Wall beds can also add sought-after storage space — especially when you work with Kloter Farms to customize the perfect Murphy bed for your unique living needs and goals. Whether you want a single Murphy bed or a queen Murphy bed, Kloter Farms can help you bring it to life.\n\nYou also have your choice of either a standard wall bed or a Murphy bed with a desk, both of which are available in six different configurations offering varying degrees of storage. Furthermore, you have the option to incorporate additional side units for extra storage for clothing, books, and other belongings.\n\nKloter Farms Murphy beds are customizable for form as well as function. Choose from four design styles and many wood, stain, and finish options to design a bed that truly expresses your personal taste and style while seamlessly integrating with the rest of your space.\n\nThe takeaway? Whatever wall bed configuration you envision, our master craftsmen will build it for you.\n\nConvenient and High-Quality Wall Beds\n\nKloter Farms is known for its exceptional and enduring high-quality solid wood furniture. The company applies the same passion for and commitment to making the very best custom wall beds as it does to all of its furniture.\n\nWhile Murphy beds have been around since the early 1900s, technology has evolved. This means that they’re easier to use than ever. If you’re worried that putting up and taking down your new Murphy bed will be difficult and time-consuming, this is not the case with a Murphy bed from Kloter Farms, which folds in and out of the wall with ease.\n\nAnother common concern about Murphy beds is comfort. Can you get a good night’s sleep on a pull-out wall bed?

Thanks again for the wonderful service and especially for the two gentlemen Tim and Ben) who made the most recent delivery. They were FANTASTIC.\nDonna T\n3 months ago\nVery good quality mattresses. I bought 3 sets. Delivered on time and they were careful and did a great job. Highly recommend.\nMichael Sawicki\n4 months ago\nJust got a new mattress and box spring delivered from Kloter Farms. Very pleased with the mattress and the delivery service by Tim & Keenan, very professional and helpful.\nLori Allison\na year ago\nWe purchased the King Size Split Integrity retractable mattress. What is great is that you can get soft, med., or firm on your side while your partner can choose whatever mattress on their side. If you get the split retractable bed, you need to watch Youtube to find an easy way to apply the twin sheets on cuz if you're short like me, you won't be able to reach the middle of the bed to slip on the corner fitted pocket. Takes a little bit more time to make the bed but I don't care. A really good investment for a really good sleep. Customer Service from Retail Store to delivery goes above and beyond to make you happy.\nBob DiCicco\na year ago\nWorking with Kloter farms was an exceptional experience fromstart to finish and the delivery people were outstanding.\nAndrew B Cavazza\na year ago\nMy wife and I purchase a Chatham Queen Turned Post Bed andConform firm Latex-Queen Bunkle Board Base and received it today it is extremely comfortable. Cathy the associate was a professional in all means. Steve in the shipping department was also a professional in scheduling the delivery. The two delivery personnel were very caring and very polite and very efficient in removing the old bed and setting up the new one. My wife and I will purchase more in the future.Thank you,Andrew & Barbara Cavazza\nDebi Stone\n2 years ago\nI shopped around and decided to purchase a mattress set from Kloter. It was during a sale and the sale was far greater than other retailers. The shopping experience was superb. No pressure, great info. and ability to test mattresses for as long as I wanted!!No high pressure or upselling. Just honest sales help! Steve was great. Gentlemen that delivered were on time, courteous and efficient.Do not hesitate to purchase from them! Good old fashioned service, high quality products…for any pocketbook!\nLinda Greenier\n3 years ago\nWe can’t say enough about customer service at Kloter Farms. From the moment we entered the showroom until we received delivery of our furniture the experience was flawless. This is our fourth purchase from Kloters. We purchased a shed, a one car garage, a dining table with 8 chairs, and just recently a new bedroom set. The workmanship and quality in the detailing is very evident on each piece. Our bedroom set was delivered yesterday by two very knowledgeable men. They took care in putting all pieces together and answering any questions we had. We would never hesitate in purchasing from Kloter Farms in the future. You get what you pay for and they stand behind their products.\n\n \n\nShop for High-Quality, Handcrafted Mattresses at Kloter Farms\n\nSleep is one of life’s most precious commodities. We all need it, yet very few of us get enough of it. If getting a good night’s sleep is at the top of your to-do list, the right mattress can make all the difference.\n\nWhether you’re looking for a queen-size mattress for your guest room or a luxury mattress for your master bedroom, a handcrafted mattress from Kloter Farms in Ellington, CT can help you get your ZZZ’s.\n\nWhy You Need a High-Quality Mattress?\n\nAll mattresses are not created equal. Depending on the brand and type of mattress you choose, you can look forward to many benefits, including the following:\n\nA good night’s sleep\n\nThis one is obvious, but it merits saying. Mattresses can offer back relief, pressure point relief, and alleviation from chronic pain. If you wake up a lot at night, toss and turn trying to fall asleep, or wake up feeling exhausted, your mattress could be to blame.\n\nUpgrading to a higher-quality mattress will change your sleep — and your life.\n\nImproved health and wellness\n\nA bad mattress = bad sleep. While inadequate sleep is frustrating, it’s far from the only consequence.\n\nOther effects of poor sleep include: lack of mental clarity and mindfulness, daytime grogginess, mood swings and irritability, poor cognitive function and performance, and exacerbated mental health conditions, such as depression, bipolar disorder, and anxiety.\n\nReduced allergies + snoring\n\nDid you know that your mattress may be making you snore and causing you to sneeze? In providing proper support, a high-quality mattress will stop you from snoring by supporting your body.\n\nYou’ll also have less exposure to dust mites when you upgrade to a new mattress.\n\nHow To Choose the Right Mattress?\n\nWhile there are many mattresses out there, it pays to take the time to find the right one for your personal preferences and needs.\n\nThe first and foremost consideration when choosing a mattress? Quality. A high-quality mattress will not only help you sleep better, but it will also last longer. Mattresses aren’t inexpensive, which is why it’s important to think of them as an investment in your health, wellness, and quality of life. While setting a budget and sticking with it is essential, don’t underestimate the actual value of a good mattress.\n\nYou’ll also want to give some thought to what size mattress you’ll need. If you’re buying a mattress for a children’s bedroom or a smaller room or multipurpose space, a twin or full-size mattress may be most appropriate. However, if you’re buying a mattress for a large master bedroom, a luxurious king-size mattress may be a better fit.\n\nAnother factor to consider when choosing a mattress? Firmness. While firm mattresses provide excellent support, plush mattresses offer consummate cushioning and a cloud-like feel.\n\nThere are pros and cons to each.\n\nFor example, while a firm mattress can help keep your spine in alignment, it may be uncomfortable for people with bad joints or back pain. On the other hand, while plush mattresses can help minimize pressure points, they may not provide as much spinal alignment support.\n\nAdditionally, the type of sleeper you are may also impact which mattress is best for you. Side sleepers, people with aches and pains, and lighter-weight people may sleep better on a plush mattress, while stomach sleepers, back sleepers, and heavier people may prefer firm mattresses.\n\nNone of these rules are hard and fast. While factors like body weight, joint health, and sleep style matter, the ultimate deciding factor is personal preference.\n\nThere are also two primary types of mattresses: spring and foam. Again, there are some key differences, but it’s also a matter of individual taste.\n\nSpring mattresses tend to be less expensive, offer good support, and move with you, but they can be noisy, and they’re also not ideal for motion isolation. On the other hand, memory foam mattresses contour to your body and provide motion isolation, but people sometimes complain about the sensation of feeling “stuck” in the mattress.\n\nIn both cases, the quality factor cannot be overstated. The higher the quality of the mattress, the less likely you are to encounter problems with it.\n\nWhy Buy a Mattress from Kloter Farms?\n\nIf you want to improve your sleep and enhance your environment in the CT, RI, or MA area, let Kloter Farms handcraft the perfect mattress for you.\n\nEvery mattress we produce is made in the USA with mindful design, superior craftsmanship, and premier materials. Our mattresses also feature meticulous details, such as luxury hand tufting, encased pocketed coils, high-density convoluted foam, total edge support, flippability, and many others.\n\nFinally, Kloter Farms mattresses come with a 20-year warranty — meaning you can expect many more years of making good on your investment.\n\nNot exactly sure what kind of mattress is best for you? Let Kloter Farms – located under 30 minutes from Hartford –  help. We’ll work with you to understand your needs and desires so that if and when you decide to go for it, you’ll know the exact thing.

Both were extremely professional and friendly, and instructed us on how to care for the furniture (and recommended a product as well). My wife and I greatly enjoyed talking to both Keegan and Ben as well. Love Kloter Farms! We have purchased numerous pieces there. Wonderful from in-store discussion at the start, to delivery at our home.\nNicolette White\n11 months ago\nFrom the moment we entered the Kloter Farms store, we were very impressed not only with the products but with the staff. Kathy is a wonderful salesperson. Our furniture was delivered yesterday by two wonderful young men, and we are very pleased with our choice.\nBob DiCicco\na year ago\nWorking with Kloter farms was an exceptional experience fromstart to finish and the delivery people were outstanding.\nCheryl James\na year ago\nI had several pieces of furniture ordered from Kloter Farms delivered today by Chris, and Keenan. Just a few words to mention how careful they were delivering my furniture, polite, helpful in placement of the pieces, and explained clearly how to care for my new pieces. Both men are an outstanding asset to your organization, and concluding the sale of the furniture on a very positive note. Thank you.\nMichele Mcmanus\na year ago\nI have been purchasing furniture from them for over 25 years. They have the highest quality furniture. They have longevity in staffing and the staff are always pleasant and helpful. No pressure to buy and they are available to answer any questions and they stand behind their products. My furniture looks today as new as it did 25 years ago. As for the delivery of my furniture they are true to their word. They give you a call the day before with a 2 hour window and they are on time. I highly recommend them to everyone. That you Kolker Farms for your outstanding products and services.\nMari Acca\na year ago\nVery helpful in the store and fast clean friendly delivery. Keep up the fine work. Thank you.\nMike Shirley\n2 years ago\nThe high quality products and customer service at Kloter Farms are unmatched in New England, I love my entertainment center and my shed!\nCharles Cappannari\n2 years ago\nWe tested the patience of the home furnishings department sales staff with our many visits to the store. We were refurnishing our lining room in our smaller condo so we had to get just the right sofa, 2 reclining chairs, and TV console. The Noah and Cathy among others cordially guided us through our choices of design, fabric, firmness, color, and coordination. Their patience and knowledge paid off as we now have a completely new lining room! On delivery day Kevin and Dominick were very helpful in moving the old furniture and setting the new pieces in place. They then explained how to care for our new fabrics and wood finish on the console. The sofa and chairs are firm and comfortable as we expected and the console looks great. Thank you Kolter Farms for an excellent home furnishings experience from sales to delivery and set up.\nKris Stanton\n2 years ago\nMy husband and I purchased 3 pieces of furniture from Kloter Farms. When we entered the store we were warmly greeted and asked if there was something specific we were interested in looking at. We were pointed toward a wonderful salesman named Carl. He did a wonderful job showing us what we were looking for and then helping us with all of the details. We purchased a Colonial Hall Bench, a Brooklyn round coffee table with a matching round end table. Carl made sure that we knew that there would be a long wait to get the items. So worth the wait! They were all 3 delivered this week within the timeframe that Carl gave us. The delivery went smoothly. They called and set up a time with another call the day before with a 2 hour window. They showed up right in the middle of the time promised. The delivery men were careful, respectful and very quick! They placed the furniture for us, gave us some care information and even a coupon for the correct kind of furniture polish for our new pieces.The whole experience was great. No complaints. The furniture is beautiful and the color matches our existing pieces flawlessly. Carl helped us with colors too! This furniture is very well built and we hope to go back for a dining table someday. We will remember to order way in advance for such quality! Thank you Carl and Kloter Farms!\nMaureen Mauro\n2 years ago\nSpectacular experience with Kloter Farms sales staff, Sean and Bonnie, great delivery scheduler Steve who is organized and clear, plus excellent delivery by the “delivery A team - Dominick and Kevin”. They offer superb products built by the Amish in the USA! We’ve also had a fine experience with Dan, a great asset in the field who serviced a product for us too. Kloter Farms invests in their products and staff not in brick and mortar furniture stores littered throughout the state. They are well worth the ride to their store. They provide a calm, educational, thoughtful and delightful sales experience and plenty of quality products choose from and to enjoy in your home.

We ordered new living room tables in December and they were delivered today. They are beautiful - even better than I pictured.

When it comes to setting up a home office that will help you be more efficient, focused, and productive, the importance of the right desk cannot be overstated. If you’re searching for the perfect home office desk to help you execute your work in style, look no further than Kloter Farms’ extensive collection of custom home office desks and other high-quality executive office furniture.\n\nShowing 1–16 of 35 results\n\nAbbie Writing Desk\nAlamo Pencil Drawer Desk\nBrown Stone Raised Panel 60″ Executive Desk\nBrown Stone Raised Panel 60″ Executive Desk with Hutch\nBrown Stone Raised Panel Corner Desk\nBrown Stone Raised Panel Corner Desk with Hutch\nBrown Stone Raised Panel Student Desk\nBrown Stone Raised Panel Student Desk with Hutch\nBrown Stone Shaker 60″ Executive Desk\nBrown Stone Shaker 60″ Executive Desk with Hutch\nBrown Stone Shaker Corner Desk\nBrown Stone Shaker Corner Desk with Hutch\nBrown Stone Shaker Kneehole Desk\nBrown Stone Shaker Kneehole Desk with Hutch\nCovington Double Pedestal Credenza Desk\nCovington Double Pedestal Credenza Desk with Hutch Top\n1\n2\n3\nNext\nChoosing the Best Home Office Desk\n\nWorking from home comes with many upsides. However, the key to making the most of remote work is to create an environment that’s truly conducive to getting the job done. Of course, the anchor of any home office space is the perfect desk.\n\nAll people have different work tasks, responsibilities, needs, and processes. Additionally, different home offices have varying space constraints. As such, not all home office desks are created equal. For example, if your office is large, you’ll have plenty of space for a large desk. However, if you’re working with a smaller room, a different option may be more appropriate,  such as one that utilizes space more efficiently like a custom computer table or executive corner desk.\n\nFrom drop front desks to writing desks, there are many different options available, each with its own benefits, depending on your unique wants and needs. For example, if you prefer to work while standing because of the health benefits, a custom adjustable standing desk may be just what you’re looking for.\n\nCustomizable Home Office Desks\n\nKloter Farms offers many customization options aimed at helping you create a desk with components that will keep you organized and on-task, such as storage, bookcase space, and more. We also have everything you need to complete the look, including home office leather desk chairs and modular home office furniture options.\n\nAn office desk is inherently utilitarian – especially when you’re attempting to carve out a workspace at home. However, function isn’t the only thing that matters when you’re decorating a remote workspace. Why? Because a home office is an extension of your living space.\n\nFor a cohesive and harmonious result, your home office design should echo the aesthetic of your entire residence. Kloter Farms has a vast assortment of desks in a variety of shapes, styles, and sizes. If you’re in search of something stately and elegant to fit in a classically appointed office, look no further than an Oak Scholar desk. Meanwhile, if you’re looking for something more contemporary, opt for a sleek desk with modern, clean lines. Plus, if you create a space you truly love, you’ll be happier spending time there – and happiness and productivity go hand-in-hand!\n\nCustomizable Home Office Desks\n\nKloter Farms offers many customization options aimed at helping you create a desk with components that will keep you organized and on-task, such as storage, bookcase space, and more.

A large desk is best for those who need room to spread out paperwork. Hardwood bookshelves are great for those needing to store many books. And office furniture with built in cabinetry is great for individuals needing file storage to keep your home office looking organized.\n\nWhat does professional home office look like?\n\nA professional home office, or an office that allows you to work from home to a professional degree, may look different to people in different positions and jobs. A home office should include, an internet connection, preferably wireless, ample desktop work space and storage space, and a professional design and feel to ensure the focus remains on the work and not other distractions.\n\nWhy buy an executive desk?\n\nAn executive office desk should provide plenty of space and storage for all of your office supplies. We might suggest an L shaped desk. This provides multiple angles to set up your work from home, space for video conferences, while also providing additional desktop and storage spaces.\n\nHow to design an executive office?\n\nIn order to design a beautiful and efficient executive office, you must consider the general flow of the space, the functionality that you need from your furniture as well as your personal work habits.\n\nWhat is a recommended size of an executive desk?\n\nA typical executive desk measures 60” to 84”W x 30”D x 30”H, but can be customized to fit your space. Consider the size of your space when thinking about a new executive desk so that it neither over nor underwhelms the room.\n\nWhat type of material is best for a modern executive office desk?\n\nHistorically solid hardwoods have been used to build executive desks because they symbolize solidity and longevity. More recently, metals and glass have been incorporated into the design of executive desks to create a juxtaposition of materials.\n\nHome Office\nModular Home Office\nCustom Desks\nLeather & Upholstered Desk Chairs\nFile Cabinets\nBookcases\nPlease Visit Our Store, Call or Email\n\nWe're here to help!\n\nGET DIRECTIONS CALL 860-375-1008 EMAIL US\nKloter Farms Blog\nHow to Design an Executive Home Office  \n\nWhether you’ve always worked remotely or COVID-related social distancing requirements have led to an unanticipated change in your work environment, having access to an organized and functional workspace is crucial.

They are a canvas for displaying your cherished collectibles, valuables, and items that hold sentimental value. Whether you’re an avid collector or simply looking to add a touch of elegance to your living space, curio cabinets offer a fantastic opportunity to showcase your unique personality and style. \n\nWe are here to help you learn what curio cabinets are, and the different ways they can be decorated. Together let’s explore six creative ideas to help you decorate your curio cabinet and transform it into a captivating focal point of your home.\n\nWhat is a Curio Cabinet?\n\nTo begin, let’s make sure we all know what curio cabinets are. A curio cabinet is a piece of furniture that is used to display different collectable or valuable objects. It’s typically constructed with glass doors that allow for the clear visibility of the items while protecting them from any irritants like dust and dirt. \n\nCurio cabinets offer a unique way to keep your cherished items organized and protected while still being in an elegant display setting. Now that we know what a curio cabinet is, let’s find out how to decorate a curio cabinet!\n\n1. Antique China and Glassware\n\nOne common idea that most people have seen or grown up with for what to put in a curio cabinet is fine china. Transform your curio cabinet into a showcase of history by displaying antique china and glassware. Delicate teacups, ornate plates, and vintage glass vases create a sense of nostalgia and elegance. Arrange them by pattern or style to create a visually pleasing display that tells the story of a long gone era.\n\n2. Souvenirs and Travel Keepsakes\n\nAnother great idea of how to decorate curio cabinets is to bring the world into your home. Use your curio cabinet to exhibit souvenirs and travel keepsakes from your adventures! This is a great way to show off unique items such as seashells from a beach getaway, mini Eiffel Tower replicas from Paris, or travel ticket stubs, anything that holds that sentimental value to you. These items not only remind you of your travels but also spark interesting conversations with visitors.\n\n3. Precious Stones and Minerals\n\nFor the nature enthusiast, curio cabinets are an excellent platform to showcase precious stones, minerals, and crystals. The play of light on gemstones like amethyst, quartz, and agate creates a mesmerizing effect. A curio cabinet is the perfect display case for items such as these. Use backlighting to enhance the beauty of translucent stones and draw attention to their intricate details.\n\n4. Vintage Cameras and Technology\n\nIf you have an affinity for vintage technology, your curio cabinet can house a unique collection of old cameras, radios, typewriters, or other technological pieces. Arrange them chronologically to showcase the evolution of design and functionality over time. This creates your own mini-museum! These items provide a nostalgic charm that can’t be replicated with modern gadgets.\n\n5. Fine Art and Sculptures: \n\nOne final idea for what to put in a curio cabinet is to turn your curio cabinet into a miniature art gallery! This can be accomplished by displaying small sculptures, miniature paintings, or artistic glass pieces. This captivating artwork selection becomes the focal point of your decor and provides an opportunity for you and guests to appreciate the fine details up close. Play with lighting to create dramatic effects that highlight the beauty of each piece.\n\nDecorating Made Easy with Kloter Farms\n\nA curio cabinet is your canvas to curate and showcase items that reflect your personality and passions.

One essential element that can instantly elevate your living room appeal is a well-decorated coffee table. \n\nThe coffee table provides an excellent opportunity to showcase your personal style while enhancing the ambiance in the entire room. But how do you decorate a coffee table? Whether you’re a minimalist or a maximalist, here are five creative ideas to decorate your coffee table and create a warm and inviting space for you and your guests to enjoy.\n\nUtilize Natural Elements\n\nWhen you’re thinking of ways of how to decorate a coffee table, keep it simple! Embrace the beauty of nature by incorporating natural elements into your coffee table decor. Start with a rustic wooden tray as a base for arranging your items. Then, add a small potted plant or a vase of fresh flowers for a refreshing touch. This easy and fun idea is a great way to decorate your coffee table while keeping it open each season. You can change the flowers, add seashells or pinecones interchangeably with the changing seasons. These natural elements not only add aesthetic appeal but also create a calming atmosphere in your living room.’]\n\nShowcase Your Library\n\nAnother fun way of how to decorate coffee table is with stacks of books and magazines. Not only will these add height and dimension to your coffee table, but also reflect your interests and personality. Select a few of your favorite books with attractive covers or titles that complement your living room’s color scheme. You can intersperse them with magazines showcasing the latest trends in home decor or your favorite hobby. The combination of books and magazines creates an inviting reading corner within your living room. Never underestimate the power of a great coffee table book!\n\nCandles and Candle Holders\n\nNothing sets a cozy mood better than the warm glow of candles. Candle holders that match your living room’s style or season can be a fun way to accent your living room. You can arrange them in varying heights on your coffee table. Scented candles can also add a pleasant aroma to the room. Opt for seasonal scents or those that evoke feelings of relaxation, such as lavender or vanilla. With candles softly illuminating the space, your living room will exude a sense of comfort and tranquility. This is a fun and unique way to decorate when determining how to decorate a coffee table tray. \n\nSentimental Value\n\nPersonalize your coffee table with a touch of sentimental value by displaying personal mementos or cherished items. This could include family photographs in elegant frames, travel souvenirs, or heirlooms that hold special memories. Mix and match these pieces to tell a story and create a sense of nostalgia. By adding these personal touches, you make your living room uniquely yours and remind yourself and your guests of the beautiful moments you’ve shared.\n\nAdd in Decorative Trays and Bowls\n\nA decorative tray or bowl can be both functional and stylish when placed on your coffee table. Use a tray to group smaller items like remote controls, coasters, or small trinkets, keeping the table neat and organized. Choose a bowl with an eye-catching design to hold items more decorative pieces like accent stones, potpourri, or little candies. These accessories add texture and interest to your coffee table, making it visually appealing and inviting.\n\nDesign and Decoration from Kloter Farms\n\nDecorating your coffee table with care and thoughtfulness can transform your living room into a cozy and inviting space where you, your family, and your guests will love spending time.

It’s a space that sets the tone for the entire interior and provides a glimpse into your personal style. It’s the last thing you see before you leave, and the first thing you see coming home. An entryway table, also known as a console table, is a fantastic opportunity to make a statement and create a warm welcome. Whether your space is grand or modest, here are some tips and ideas to help you discover how to decorate an entryway table.\n\n1. Start with a Solid Foundation\n\nBefore you dive into decorating, choose the right entryway table. Consider the size of your space and the style of your home. Whether it’s a sleek modern table, a rustic wooden piece, or a warm live edge style, the table should complement the overall design scheme.\n\n2. Keep It Functional\n\nWhile aesthetics are important, remember that the entryway table serves a purpose. It’s a functional space where you can drop your keys, mail, or other essentials as you come and go. Consider adding a tray or decorative bowl to corral these items and keep the table organized.\n\n3. Mirror, Mirror on the Wall\n\nNow, let’s get into how to style entryway table. A well-placed mirror above the entryway table not only adds visual interest but also creates the illusion of a larger space. Mirrors reflect light and can make your entryway feel brighter and more welcoming. Choose a mirror that suits your style, whether it’s a sleek modern design or an ornate vintage frame.\n\n4. Add Greenery\n\nPlants and flowers bring life to any space and is a great option for what to put on an entryway table. Consider placing a potted plant or a vase of fresh flowers on your console table. Greenery adds a touch of nature and a pop of color that can instantly elevate the space.\n\n5. Layer with Art and Decor\n\nAnother way of planning how to decorate entryway table is layering. Layering is key to creating a visually appealing display. Start with a focal point, such as a piece of art, and build around it. Consider varying heights and textures to add depth. A decorative tray, a stack of books, or a small sculpture can all contribute to a well-layered arrangement.\n\n6. Balance and Symmetry\n\nIf you prefer a more traditional and balanced look, opt for symmetry. Place matching items on either side of the table, such as a pair of lamps, decorative candles, or identical vases. Symmetry creates a sense of order and sophistication.\n\n 7. Embrace Your Style\n\nYour entryway table is a chance to showcase your personality and style! Whether you love a minimalist aesthetic, bohemian vibes, or classic elegance, infuse your unique taste into the arrangement. Choose decor that resonates with you and makes you feel at home.\n\n8. Seasonal Switches\n\nDon’t be afraid to update your entryway table decor with the changing seasons. In the spring and summer, opt for lighter colors and fresh blooms. During the fall and winter, warm up the space with cozy textures and seasonal elements. Fun seasonal candles, fall leaves, and summer seashells are great entryway accent pieces. \n\n9. Lighting Matters\n\nLighting is an important part of what to put on entryway table! Good lighting can transform the ambiance of your entryway. Consider adding table lamps or wall sconces to provide both functional and atmospheric lighting. The right lighting can make your entryway feel inviting, especially during evening hours.\n\n10. Less is More\n\nWhile it’s exciting to decorate your entryway table, remember that less can often be more. Avoid overcrowding the space with too many items. A clutter-free table allows each piece to shine and makes a stronger impact. With small decorative pieces, it’s easy to switch out and redesign with the season! Remember that the items you pick now don’t have to stay there forever. \n\nInterior Design Experts at Kloter Farms\n\nIn the end, decorating your entryway table is a chance to create a warm and stylish welcome for both you and your guests!

SHOP SALE\nHome\n Blog\n For Your Home\n Kitchen & Dining\n Rustic Wooden Kitchen Cabinet Ideas We Love for 2024\nRustic Wooden Kitchen Cabinet Ideas We Love for 2024\nAugust 16, 2024\n\nYear after year, we continue to see rustic kitchen cabinets as one of the leading styles of cabinetry design. There is something classic and familiar about the style, which is why we believe its popularity has yet to fade. This classic style can easily be molded to fit itself into other home trends. \n\nOf the vast array of styles, there are subgenres that we believe will take lead in 2024 as front runners of kitchen & home design. Here are some of our predicted trendsetting rustic kitchen cabinet ideas for 2024.\n\nModern Rustic Wooden Cabinets\n\nAdd a modern twist to your rustic wooden cabinets! Golden, brass, and silver hardware can add sophistication to the existing rustic cabinetry. Opt for white cabinetry or neutral tones for a calming and lived-in look. Kitchen islands are at their height of popularity, so add a freestanding kitchen island to round out your modern rustic wooden kitchen cabinets. \n\nThis style for kitchen cabinetry can utilize any wood species such as: oak, maple, cherry, or rustic hickory kitchen cabinets. There are no limitations to what you can design. \n\nCoastal Rustic Kitchen Cabinets\n\nAt the intersection of coastal cottage and modern farmhouse is coastal rustic. The coastal rustic kitchen cabinet style brings bright, light, and airy charm to your kitchen space. Accent your kitchen with clean wicker accents and natural wood seating to bring in the earthy ambiance. \n\nThis style will work best with kitchens that have a lot of natural lighting. This allows for your décor and details to play off of the existing elements right outside your door. Dress up your windows with airy linens to round out the look. \n\nTraditional Farmhouse & Rustic Country Cabinets\n\nThe traditional farmhouse theme leans more into the richer color tones – dark browns, burgundy, forest greens.  This paired with darker stained woods and country accents really create a traditional feel. The rustic country kitchen cabinets should give your kitchen a warm and homey feel. While the other trends we’ve explored lean more into the minimalist look, a traditional farmhouse kitchen is considered more of a maximalist setting. \n\nMaximalist settings are centered on vibrancy, architecture, and busyness. Pair your rustic farmhouse cabinets with a busy printed wallpaper in your kitchen or shelving with lots of accent pieces to really complete the look. To add to the farmhouse and barn theme, add sliding barn doors to your kitchen entryway or on your kitchen island!\n\nRustic Kitchen Cabinetry with a Pop of Color\n\nDance on the side of bold and add color to your rustic wooden kitchen cabinetry! If bright and cheery is your style, try painting your cabinets or kitchen island in a bold color, like orange or yellow. Keep in mind primary colors and complementary colors from the wheel – red and green, blue and orange, yellow and purple. Even adding a more muted version of these colors will add a personal touch and charm to your kitchen. \n\nSome people fear that these bold colors will be hard to maintain or keep them in their best condition. Adding distressing to your cabinets with these colors will give it a lived in look and also make them look more farmhouse. Adding a pop of color or an accent section will add much needed life and personality to your kitchen. \n\nThe Basics – Rustic White Kitchen Cabinets\n\nTrendy, classic, and timeless – white kitchen cabinets are one of the most popular colors and design trends that we’ve seen time and time again the past several years. The clean white look pairs well with seemingly all styles of woods, other paints, and stains. Tone it down and make it more farmhouse with some distressing. \n\nPair your kitchen cabinets with a live edge island top or live edge kitchen dining table. Natural woods have an enhanced look when paired with the crisp clean white. For added dramatization of your kitchen cabinets, add black or dark brown accents for your kitchen cabinet hardware.\n\nFind Your Design Style at Kloter Farms\n\nRustic farmhouse, coastal rustic kitchen cabinets, or elegant white cabinet style – there is a style for everyone.

Average Weights For a New Mattress\nJuly 24, 2024\n\nThere are so many factors that contribute to a mattresses weight. Size, age, and material, can all affect the weight of your mattress. So, does the weight make a difference in the quality or function? When shopping for a new mattress, what weights should you look for? We’re sleep experts here at Kloter Farms and are here to help you with your mattress FAQ. Together, let’s learn about mattress weights before you make your big purchase.\n\nHow Much Does a Mattress Weigh\n\nOn average, a typical mattress can weigh anywhere from 50-150 pounds. The size of mattress can greatly impact the weight. Let’s review some of the varying sizes of the mattresses and their appropriate weights.\n\nMattress Sizes\nTwin Mattresses\n\nA twin mattress is the most compact; it measures 38 inches by 75 inches long. Its size makes it the ideal mattress for children, bunk beds, single adults, and studio apartments. Because of its smaller footprint, a twin mattress will be the least heavy, weighing on average between 40-100 pounds.\n\nFull Mattress\n\nA full-size mattress is slightly larger than the twin, measuring at 54 inches wide by 74 inches long. The next step up from a twin mattress, a full mattress is usually best for older children, teenagers, and single adults. These mattresses weigh between 50-110 pounds.\n\nQueen Mattress\n\nFollowing the full-size mattresses, queen mattresses are 60 inches by 80 inches. But how much does a queen mattress weigh?  The typical weight will be anywhere between 120 and 160 pounds.\n\nKing Mattress\n\nHow much does a king mattress weigh? And how much does a California king mattress weigh? A slight variation between these two in size, with the king being 76×80 inches, and the California king between 72×84 inches. These two will similarly weigh between 130-180 pounds. Their larger dimensions result in their increased weights.\n\nMattress Materials\n\nThe materials which make up the mattress also contribute to its weight. High quality mattresses can come in a variety of different materials and compositions. Some of the common mattress materials include memory foam, innerspring, latex, and hybrids.\n\nMemory Foam Mattresses\n\nA memory foam mattress can be heavier than an innerspring mattresses due to the density of the foam. On average, these can weigh anywhere from 60-150 pounds.  They are not the heaviest of all the mattress, but they’re close. \n\nInnerspring Mattresses\n\nAn innerspring mattress is made up of steel coils that support the base and a comfort layer of foam. The weight of these mattresses is dependent on the quality and density of the coils.\n\nLatex Mattresses\n\nLatex mattresses can be heavier than other mattresses. This is all dependent on the layers and density of the foam! The more materials that make up the mattresses composition will make the mattress heavier.\n\nWeight of a New Mattress\n\nIt’s unlikely that a mattress will change drastically in weight over time. From the time your mattress is new versus your mattress being 5-10 years old, the weight may vary slightly. This would be unnoticeable.  \n\n Kloter Farms Mattress Selection\n\nAt Kloter Farms, our mattresses are made up of only the finest materials, and we even have an organic mattress line! All American made, Kloter Farms mattresses are made with the strongest innersprings in the industry, high density foam, and completely customizable. Our mattresses also exceed the industry standard and have a 20 year warranty, covering any mattress impressions of a ½ inch or more! With a variety of memory foam, latex, and pocketed coil mattresses, you’ll be sure to find a great night’s sleep here at Kloter Farms.\n\nShare This\nFacebook\n \nTwitter\n \nPinterest\n \nEmail\nRelated Articles\nHow to Improve Your Kitchen Storage with a Custom Island\nOct 11, 2021\nHow Often Should You Rotate Your Mattress?

The outdoor equipment is happy too😀\nSusan Chambers\na month ago\nWe tried recliner chairs. Mary asked if we needed help. I advised her that I had compressed discs in my neck. It was a huge sale day but Mary said she wanted to make sure I got the correct chair for my needs. We tried 4 chairs and she checked my shoulder neck and arms. She had me resit in certain chairs. We totally had 100% focus and customer service. Made sure the chair could be customized to what I needed. Mary then helped us by asking the colors in the room and brought samples to me. The absolute best customer service I have had in my life. Class furniture and sales representatives.\nMerri Scarbrough\na month ago\nKloter Farms is fantastic!

Their willingness to find the right shed at the right price was most noteworthy. Everything from the purchase, site prep, and delivery was professional and well communicated. Steve went above and beyond with the site prep and I learned that \"level\" and \"flat\" are not the same thing. Delivery was a site to behold - Dan got the shed on the pad within an 1/8 inch of dead center and was willing to spend as much time getting it right as needed. I cannot say enough about this company and the experience!\nLinda B\na month ago\nHugh Anderson\na month ago\nWe had a great experience with Kloter Farms.

We purchased a shed from Kloter Farms and could not be more pleased with the service and quality of the product. Our salesperson, Kim M, was an absolute delight to work with. She took videos and pictures of the shed we were interested in and shared a ton of info which gave us the comfort to buy it without going to the showroom.

Could not be happier, it is perfect and well worth the price!\nCarol Barry\n4 months ago\nI purchased a recliner not long ago. The chair is comfortable and fits nicely in our living room.

I called Steve at the store and immediately a staff member was sent to the house who made some minor adjustments. We couldn’t be happier! We also were given the assurance that they would come back in the future if there needed to be any adjustments. Steve assured me that the store’s customers are their top priority. It is a relief to find that Kloter farms takes pride in the craft of their furniture unlike many of the area furniture stores. We were so pleased with the experience that we also bought a desk there. I would definitely recommend this store\nNanny Machado\n5 months ago\nKloter Farms is wonderful. The staff at the store are friendly and knowledgeable. They have great quality furniture.

They are professional, punctual and efficient. The final product is worth the investment. That said, just a couple words of advice if you are inexperienced with these types of builds and the process (like me). First, unless you know who you’re dealing with on the concrete side stick with Kloter and their subcontractors, it will save you time and likely money in the longer run. Second, you do need to ask for a break down of what is to be expected with respect to permits, expectations and time line. That said Kloter’s representatives are responsive and will provide a breakdown of requirements and expectations upon request.\nNina Crapser\n8 months ago\nWe just had a 30 year old gazebo that was purchased originally from Kloter moved from my in-laws to our home & EVERYONE we worked with was awesome! Lisa & Nick in the office helped us navigate the move process & Dan & Bill took this family “heirloom” from Springfield to Stafford flawlessly. The customer service is excellent & so is the craftsmanship on this gazebo. After 30 years it’s still in wonderful shape.\nJeffrey Gebrian\n8 months ago\nWe had heard that Kloter Farms had a good and reliable reputation when we were planning for a new, detached garage. We followed up and visited their premises Fall of 2022. Our experience began with a friendly and professional tour of the facilities by a sales person ending with a close look at a 20' by 20' garage which we knew would fit our tight site. Our questions and comments about budgets and schedule were clearly and professionally answered. From there we decided to go ahead and received the same high level of service from contract to schedule to construction; from the footing, foundation and floor to the building walls, doors and roof. Every single person who worked on every aspect of this garage knew what they were doing and did so in a very courteous, skilled and professional manner. We will highly recommend Kloter Farms.

From the moment I contacted Kloter Farm about an in stock shed they had until the truck pulled away after delivering it, everything was 10 STARS. Kim in Sales was excellent in every aspect, sending pictures, payment options, site preparation and delivery notifications. Tyler, the delivery genius was a master at his craft, maneuvering the truck and trailer into my back yard to perfectly place the shed. I got the impression he could have done it in his sleep. The shed is beautiful and constructed extremely well. I certainly made the right choice and I would recommend Kloter Farms to anyone who asks.\nMichael Keating\na year ago\nWell, it was a wonderful experience to work with Jason and his team to complete this final phase of a restoration project of an old Victorian home.From start to finish the team helped us in every way.Thank you Jason, John, Kevin (and sons)… can’t leave out delivery and garage door crew.I now have a gazebo, shed and garage. Thanks again. Mike\nLynn Clark\na year ago\nThis is the second time we have gone to Kloter for a structure on our property.The first was a large shed and that experience was very gratifying and we love our little barn. It's too beautiful to be called a shed. This time we went for a two car garage and the experience was amazing. First, Jason Kloter came to our home with a truckful of samples, pictures, ideas, etc. and sat with us for two hours helping us design the garage. It is now up and looks fabulous. The team that built the foundation and redesigned the driveway as well as the team that assembled the garage were excellent. We cannot thank you all enough.\nDavid Ascenza Sr\na year ago\nKloter Farms is an amazing shopping experience, the staff is professional, knowledgeable as well as friendly. We were looking for a glass top dining table for our kitchen and we were informed they didn’t have anything with a glass top. The sales associate Steve ended up talking to the manager and they custom built one which now is available in their line up. Delivery was on time and placed in our home with care. If I could give Kloter Farms more than five stars in this review I would. Many thanks…Dave & Donna Ascenza\nJohnny O\na year ago\nWe are extremely pleased with the garage Kloter Farms built for us and the service they provided from start to finish. Bottom line: If we had to do it all over, we would use Kloter Farms again without a second thought.I grew up in a family of skilled and perfectionist craftsmen. Matt and his build crew are cut from the same cloth. From the very beginning, Matt's client service and communication were top notch. We worked through all the planning together and his experience was invaluable in helping us develop a customized plan to suit our needs and budget. Matt remained hands-on during critical phases of construction, working alongside the build team to ensure perfect fit and finish. And the build team, led by J & R, were incredible too. I have not seen harder working or more skilled tradesmen. The product itself is of superior build. No skimping on construction methods and materials...actually better than stick-built in several ways. Finally, they never missed their schedule. Wow, how often does that happen in construction these days??\nG W\na year ago\nWe ordered a bedroom set including a couple of custom pieces. We are so happy with our furniture. It is the Norwalk set from Veraluxe. The furniture is top quality. And Kloter Farms was so easy to work with. Delivery came when promised, and the whole process of ordering online was very smooth. They are so nice and friendly too. I recommend Kloter,and Veraluxe for all your furniture needs.\nChristopher Siart\na year ago\nI purchased a pool house and a pavilion thru Paul Roberts. The entire experience was fantastic. Paul's knowledge of their offerings is awesome. He was extremely helpful and patient with my decision making process. The installation was also very good; on time and top notch quality. I will definitely be purchasing more items from Kloter Farms in the near future.\nGraham Broberg\na year ago\nMy Garage exceeded my expectations and the price was very competitive! Jason personally assessed my site and helped me with the plans.\nTheresa D Graham\na year ago\nKeenan and Chris did an outstanding job with the delivery and set up of our recent purchase. They arrived on time, were friendly, highly professional, and explained the care for our upholstered items in detail. We will definitely visit Kloter Farms’ beautiful showroom again for future purchases!Thank you!T Graham\nNicholas Wahl. III\na year ago\nJust received our new dining room table. Our experience from the sales personnel to the two gentlemen who not only delivered the table but set it up and explained its care for future use was exemplary We are 100% pleased and look forward to using our new table for many years to come\nAndrew Gilman\na year ago\nKloter Farms was very thorough and professional in helping us design and the build our new garage. They did a site survey, provided detailed plans for permits, had an excellent sub-contractor to lay the foundation and had a skilled building team. Most important, we are very pleased with the finished garage. Andy Gilman\nAnne Riva\na year ago\nI just received my kitchen island and couldn't be happier. It's gorgeous! The delivery guys were great!\nSimi Capano\na year ago\nI took a drive to Kloter Farms last weekend...hour and a half from Stamford. Beautiful drive through rural Connecticut. I visited the two stores, this one, and the one with the kitchen islands and full kitchens. I ordered a kitchen island and chairs. Everything is customized. I am happy with the price and probably would have cost much more if I shopped in Lower Fairfield County or Westchester Country. Thank you Sierra for your patience and expertise. Delivery takes several months, so I'm glad I decided to order now. Can't wait to see the final product.\nKathy Tuozzo\na year ago\nGreat experience with Kloter Farms from purchase to delivery! The staff are knowledgeable about their products and friendly. Delivery was exceptional - they were on time, took every precaution, made sure I was happy and made sure I understood how to care for my new bedroom furniture. Will definitely purchase from Kloter Farms again!\nEric Elman\na year ago\n10/10. Yes, A+++. Steve and his team were exceptional to work with. Steve is down to earth, a straight shooter, right to the point, and his knowledge level is seemingly beyond his years. His crew was professional and courteous at every step of the way. Cabinets, well they are fully custom and when you compare woods used, thickness, joinery, hardware and finish they cannot be beat by anyone - and we did our due diligence. One of the major differences with Kloter kitchens is that the team that designs the kitchen, is the same team that installs the kitchen. Unlike other companies, they also provide a firm install date shortly after the contract is signed. Sure enough, the install took place on the day promised and they sized the install crew to get the job done in one day. Sure, a couple of small details needed tending to after the install, but they were back just as promised. Dan, their repair man was also prompt, courteous and very knowledgable taking care of the few details to our satisfaction. I am very particular and have high expectations - Kloter met, and exceeded them in some cases. Very highly recommended.\nPatricia Broskey\na year ago\nStephen helped make our dreams come true! From design to construction we could not have been happier. Stephen makes sure the function works and provides all the thoughtful ideas to add additional efficiency. We love the quality of the cabinets as much as the look. Kloter farms was exceptional to work with!! If you are looking for a new kitchen definitely go visit… you will not be disappointed!\nSusan Gerr\na year ago\nWe recently were in the market for a new sectional couch for our living room remodeling project. We have been customers of Kloter Farms for decades, and know they only sell quality pieces. We found the perfect couch with the right configuration to fit our room, and a great choice of fabric. The salesperson was extremely helpful and knowledgeble. The couch came a month ahead of estimated time and the delivery and setup crew was very prompt, courteous and thorough.\nVincent Vassallo\na year ago\nWent to Kloter Farms for a replacement shed. The whole company is top notch. Great salesperson, Kim. The site work man was great and did good work. She'd looks great, had a bubble in one of the siding pieces when shed arrived on Tuesday, contacted the company and siding was replaced Thursday the same week. Great customer service all around. Thanks for making our shed buying experience seamless. Vin and Kelly Vasssllo\nJanice Favreau\na year ago\nWe have been customers of Kloter Farms since the purchase of our home 8 years ago, and are extremely pleased with the quality of the product and the service received. From an outdoor shed to the new bed we just received - wonderful service from the store to delivery!\nChris L\na year ago\nKloter Farms just finished our new 32x26 Elite 2 story garage and we couldn't be happier with both the finished product and the whole experience working with the Kloter Team! This project was extensive and challenging, including demolition of an old garage and slab, navigating many planning and unique site challenges given the lot size, and ultimately the actual build process (which was amazingly quick, on-time as promised, and painless). From the start, Jason and his team worked with us extensively to help plan out the many custom features we wanted, like extra height walls and doors, maximum dormers on the 2nd floor for space (the 2nd floor is HUGE), custom stairway location, custom door spacing, matching our house siding, etc.). The build quality and quality of the materials is outstanding (and we are picky). Even the building inspector commented on the high quality. Many thanks to John (old garage demo, excavation, foundation, and very careful work in a tight space), Kevin, his Sons and Will for the incredibly quick and painless build experience, and Jason for his extensive experience and advice on how to smooth out the inevitable challenges, and patience with my many questions. It's so refreshing to work with a local family business that treats its customers and its people (many of whom I spoke with have worked there for 20+ years) so well. Much appreciated, and we'll be back (dining room set is next on the list...)\nEric Zimmerman\na year ago\nPaul was very helpful and the glider is awesome for my daughter and granddaughter!! Would highly recommend this product!\nLori Allison\na year ago\nWe purchased the King Size Split Integrity retractable mattress. What is great is that you can get soft, med., or firm on your side while your partner can choose whatever mattress on their side. If you get the split retractable bed, you need to watch Youtube to find an easy way to apply the twin sheets on cuz if you're short like me, you won't be able to reach the middle of the bed to slip on the corner fitted pocket. Takes a little bit more time to make the bed but I don't care. A really good investment for a really good sleep. Customer Service from Retail Store to delivery goes above and beyond to make you happy.\nOff Grid King\na year ago\nThank you so much to Fred and Carl for making our experience with Kloter Farms so enjoyable and easy in furnishing our new farm house. More pics to come with our new dining room and living room once complete!\nDeb Bacewicz\na year ago\nWe just had our new family room furniture delivered - a sectional, recliner and end table. The furniture is beautiful and high quality. The delivery guys were very careful, considerate and respectful. We are thrilled. Thank you all.\nBob DiCicco\na year ago\nWorking with Kloter farms was an exceptional experience fromstart to finish and the delivery people were outstanding.\nleah gerber\na year ago\nOur kitchen experience with Kloter Farms was perfect and seamless. From the design, the install, the finishing touches, and the photos we are more than pleased with the outcome. We were remodeling an older home and Kloter Farms was able to design everything we were looking for in a small layout! We can’t rave about their team enough! Thank you!\nMary Ann Hanley\na year ago\nWe just purchased two couches for our living room and had the most enjoyable experience. From the sales personnel-who are helpful but definitely not pushy-through the delivery. Steve called to let us know what time to expect our delivery and they were there just as he said. Orion and Chris carried in the furniture and explained how to care for them. And, most importantly, you really felt the pride that all of them had for the work that they perform and for the company that they work for-quite a rarity these days. Thank you to all.\nDenise Egan\na year ago\nWorking with Stephen and his team on my beautiful kitchen was a pleasure from start to finish. They go over and beyond to deliver everything promised and more. The quality of the cabinets is exceptional. Thank you!\nLaura Byers\na year ago\nI am extremely happy with our kitchen remodel and the quality of the kitchen cabinets. The staff were professional, courteous and easy to work with. I would definitely recommend Kloter Farms.\nLaura Palmer\na year ago\nWe could not be happier with our entire experience! Highly recommend.\nRobert Urban\na year ago\nMy garage looks great, matches house perfectly. Kloter team does a great job and are hard working. The delivery trailer is a riot. Got all the pieces in place with one man and a remote control. I would recommend Kloter.\nJohn Allen\na year ago\nWe just had a complete bedroom set delivered. The furniture is beautiful and high quality. The delivery guys were very careful, considerate and respectful. Perfect experience.\nNoreen Quinn\na year ago\nIt was a wonderful experience from start to finish. This kind of customer service is hard to find. I worked with the most helpful, patient sales person who had a really good eye. Couch and chair arrived sooner than anticipated. Quality is excellent, delivery was smooth. Kloter Farms is now my destination for home furnishings.\nCheryl James\na year ago\nI had several pieces of furniture ordered from Kloter Farms delivered today by Chris, and Keenan. Just a few words to mention how careful they were delivering my furniture, polite, helpful in placement of the pieces, and explained clearly how to care for my new pieces. Both men are an outstanding asset to your organization, and concluding the sale of the furniture on a very positive note. Thank you.\nKathryn Perleoni\na year ago\nEverything was great! From our initial sales rep to the delivery people, Kloter Farms has top-notch customer service! Their furniture is high quality and built to last! We're very happy with our leather living room set.\nGene Lacerte\na year ago\nOnce again Kloter Farms met their high standards. My new Elran Recliner was delivered on time and the delivery people were accomodating and pleasant to work with. I have been dealing with Kloter Farms for over 10 years and have never been disappointed with their service or quality of the furniture they sell. I highly recommend them to family and friends.\nKathi Young\na year ago\nWe received our couch last week. It is perfect!

I would not hesitate to buy any furniture from Kloter.\nCharlotte Cyr\na year ago\nToday we received our couch, love seat, swivel chair and ottoman from Kloter Farms. This is our first purchase from them and we are so pleased with the quality and look of it. We want to extend our gratitude to our salesperson, Clarissa. She was so knowledgeable about the product and fabric colors. Her decorating ‘eye’ was spot on. Also thanks to the two gentlemen who delivered it. They were so careful not to bang the furniture into anything in their way. Thank you all.\nNancy Zimmerman\na year ago\nWe needed a new sleeper sofa and Fred was great!

The staff is always kind, welcoming, and professional, including the delivery men who call ahead of arrival which is so appreciated. Thank you especially to Carl in Sales, and Chris and Keenan who delivered our recliner!\nMark Christodlous\na year ago\nI received my 12x24 today and it was everything I Expected it to be, kim was a pleasure to work with and made it simple and easy to order, the 2 gentleman that came and delivered it were amazing and nailed it exactly where i wanted it to go with no issues at all.

They answered all questions and made it so easy to work with them. The young gentlemen who delivered our bedroom furniture were incredibly polite and efficient. We would recommend them to all.\nMichele Mcmanus\na year ago\nI have been purchasing furniture from them for over 25 years. They have the highest quality furniture. They have longevity in staffing and the staff are always pleasant and helpful. No pressure to buy and they are available to answer any questions and they stand behind their products. My furniture looks today as new as it did 25 years ago. As for the delivery of my furniture they are true to their word. They give you a call the day before with a 2 hour window and they are on time. I highly recommend them to everyone. That you Kolker Farms for your outstanding products and services.\nLee DesRoches\na year ago\nWe visited 3 custom cabinet makers in CT before settling on Kloter Farms. Our kitchen is pretty small and was not a very good use of space. Stephen was able to make subtle changes to our kitchen layout that made our small space more usable with a more spacious feeling. We are able to utilize more storage in our new kitchen and we don't constantly bump into each other when cooking and prepping our meals.Even if you are a handy person, I would recommend having Kloter Farms do the cabinet installation because they are not just professional as the label goes, they truly are top notch and get the job done quickly. Things like uneven floors and walls are taken into account so your cabinets look as if they were built with your house without unsightly gaps. They even take into account small details like floor tile grout channels, making it look like the cabinet is “melted” to the floor. Hard to beat that kind of quality work and the installation price is not that bad considering they come in with a crew on a mission to get your kitchen up and running as soon and efficiently as possible.All time frames were met as discussed months prior during the project planning phase, no disappointing delays or cancellations, thoroughly professional. Stephen is also good at giving design advice based on what look you are going for. Once you communicate what you want, he will make the best suggestions based on your needs. He is very responsive during the the entire process, from selection to planning, to post install, making you feel reassured whenever you have a question or need advice.The cabinets are high quality and seem very durable. We went with stained cabinets and the wood is smoother than I have seen on any cabinets. The protective finish is also a nice touch and all hardware like slides and internal organizers are of the highest quality, think trade sourced quality, not things you can find in your local home improvement store. We even had a cabinet tech as part of our installation who filled nail holes and matched the colors perfectly as well as “fine tune” all the doors and drawers so they work flawlessly.A truly great experience for our remodel and we are very happy with the layout changes, cabinets, and service we received from Kloter Farms!\nLynn Warriner\na year ago\nThe furniture is beautiful, and excellent quality! We have purchased many pieces of furniture for our home, and have been extremely satisfied!! The customer service in the store, and on the phone and the delivery employees are all excellent, polite, and very professional!!!\nElizabeth Murphy\na year ago\nIt was a pleasure shopping at Kloter Farms and we are very happy with the bedroom furniture set we purchased.

We will definitely shop at Kloter Farms again.\nEdward Sederquest\na year ago\nExcellent products and service.\nRebecca Pond\na year ago\nGREAT EXPERIENCE!Becky my sales representative was amazing!The guys that delivered today were professional and nice.Could not be happier!Highly recommend!Thank youRebecca\ntracey bennett\na year ago\nWe couldn't be happier with our recent furniture purchase of a sofa , armchair , mission cabinet and dining room chairs , fabulous quality and the staff from the point of sales to delivery and placement were equally as fabulous\nTerry Brennan\na year ago\nI just received the leather recliner and chair I ordered. They are gorgeous. The help I received from the Kloter Farms team was amazing. Their delivery staff was also professional and careful when they were placing the chairs. They also took the time to put felt pads on the feet. I have also ordered a sectional and can't wait for that to arrive. This store and it's staff are wonderful.\nAndrew B Cavazza\na year ago\nMy wife and I purchase a Chatham Queen Turned Post Bed andConform firm Latex-Queen Bunkle Board Base and received it today it is extremely comfortable.

I had to wait a bit for my order, but it came in before they said, in time for Christmas. The delivery team was prompt, pleasant and professional! I’m a happy girl! Thanks to all!\nJoseph Twarkins\na year ago\nWe recently purchased a sofa from Kloter Farms and are very satisfied with the quality of this American-made product.Our Salesman (Carl)was very professional and knowledgeable regarding product & options.When two young men delivered our sofa this week, they also were professional and on-time with delivery.They also advised us regarding fabric maintenance recomendations.We purchased a storage shed from Kloter Farms many years ago and that American-made product also was built to a high quality standard and was exceptional.\nJeffrey Tucker\na year ago\nSolid, well-made furniture at reasonable prices. No particle board, or case goods made from old orange crates! Wide selection of styles, woods (oak or cherry, plus some others), stains, and hardware. The guys who delivered my bed, dresser, and nightstand were great, and made sure everything was right before they left.\nJeffrey Crompton\na year ago\nJason and his team made the process easy, and were helpful getting the town in line with a structure this size. We went with kloter after a great experience with a shed at our last home, on a reference from my parents, who's shed is now 30 years old and going strong!\nEdgar Hettrich\na year ago\nIt was a pleasure working with Kloter Farms Jason on the new 2-Car Garage. Kloter Farms was very patient with me as I went through the red tape and challenges of demolishing a 16’x18’ garage that of course had lead in the wood. Although this led to a long delay I was finally able to proceed and Kloter worked with me on a schedule that got the structure completed before this winter. It is a beautiful 1-1/2 story 2 4’x28’ garage. We’ll enjoy this for years and it is sure to add value to our property.\nKate Dubuque\na year ago\nWe purchased our\"office in late 2019. We run a small dog rescue; Little Rhody Rescue and Quarantine Inc in Glocester RI.First, the team was professional, courteous and my finished product was EXACTLY what I ordered and wanted. The price was reasonable - especially for the quality that I received!We received a beautiful grant from the singer Miranda Lambert's Mutt Nation Foundation. We cleared trees, prepped for the bug day ! Delivery was flawless and SO fast!....Then the pandemic hit. Our 'office' allowed us to hold adoption events even when all of the stores were closed to adoption events.This beautiful 'Shed' has become a lifeline and helped us to save 1,200 dogs' and cats' lives- all because it enabled us to continue our work!!!Thanks I can recommend no one more!\nJishnu Gupta\na year ago\nFantastic furniture and an excellent delivery experience. They put everything together, arrived at exactly 1 minute ahead of the scheduled 2 hr window (10:44 instead of 10:45!) and worked quickly and diligently. The furniture is beautiful and exactly what we expected. It is heirloom quality.\nMichael Magner\na year ago\nMy shed was delivered yesterday and I can't tell you how happy I am with it! It has solved all of my outdoor storage needs and then some, and it is beautiful! A special shout-out to Tyler the delivery guy. I was thoroughly amazed at his expertise in getting into my difficult driveway (even the garbage man won't come down it) and the way he handled that trailer all by himself and landed the shed exactly where I wanted it. It's 10 X 20\" so no easy task. I highly recommend these guys! Thanks again Tyler!\nJohn Briare\na year ago\nAbsolutely Amazing Company and Staff. Bought a 12x14 Cape Shed. I was at the tail end of a major patio renovation and decided to demolish a mouse infested shed that I have had for 30 years. Problem was... I needed the shed delivered within 2 weeks before area would become non-accessible. I first went to a shed dealer down the road... was told it would be 8-12 weeks... nothing they could do. Thinking I was going to be building the new shed myself... I tried Kloter Farms. I told them my dilemma and they said no problem... they could get it done within 2 weeks. Walked the yard... found a beautiful shed... signed the paperwork and literally got a call within 36 hours and shed was delivered to my house within 72 hours of first stepping foot in their showroom. They bailed me out big time. As far as price... I understand building a shed would save money... but with screws running $40 for 5 lbs, and lumber prices insane... It cost me about $1500 over cost of materials, not including tax, to simply buy the shed from Kloter. I will never build my own shed again. Great Quality... ask for Joe Schneider (Sales Rep I dealt with)\nSherry Michaud\na year ago\nLinda Aschenbach\na year ago\nDelivery was a few minutes earlier. The 2 gentlemen placed my new bedroom set exactly where I requested. When I asked the the guys what they thought, the response was “awesome” and it is.

We chose Kloter Farms to replace our 45-year-old kitchen. We received excellent service at every step of the process, from designing the new layout, selecting the best style and finishes, and though the installation process. The quality of the cabinets was only matched by the skillful carpentry and attention to detail of Stephen and his installation team. Our kitchen ceiling, walls and floor are very crooked. Stephen expertly scribed and shimmed the cabinets and moldings to correct for our kitchen’s unevenness. We are extremely pleased with our new custom kitchen and have received many compliments from family and friends.
